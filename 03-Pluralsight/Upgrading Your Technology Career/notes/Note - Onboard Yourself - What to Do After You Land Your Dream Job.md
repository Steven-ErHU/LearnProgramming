### Taking Ownership in Your Job
#### Course Introduction

<-----onboarding has a purpose of helping new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members and insiders.----->

Now when we're hired to do technical things like programming or networking or something like that, we should already have the knowledge and skills and probably behaviors to become effective in the organization and our department or division.

That's what we were hired for.

I'm not talking about the list of things that HR needs you to do or the list of things that your boss needs you to do so they know that you're ready to do your job.

<-----I'm talking about taking personal ownership of your future at the company.----->

<-----How do you hand the projects that are assigned to you? ----->
<-----Are you friendly and nice to other people? ----->
<-----Are you a good cultural fit? ----->
There are a number of things that the company, HR and your boss, is going to walk you through, but your boss is going to continue watching you to see if they hired the right person.

#### Traditional Onboarding vs.Personal Onboarding

we're looking for in the personal onboarding column.

For example, can I do my job? 
<-----If I can't do my job, what are the things that I need?----->
<-----Do I need my role redefined or better defined? ----->
<-----Do I need certain tools?-----> 
<-----Do I need other tools that the company didn't think of? ----->
<-----Maybe there are tools, techniques, or ideas that I learned in previous companies thatwould be greatly beneficial in this organization.----->

Do I fit in culturally? It's always weird to be the new person in the organization.

You have to find out what the pecking order is.

<-----You have to find out how things work within your division.----->

<-----find out how much power your boss does or doesn't have within the organization.----->

You need to develop a strategy to help you figure out how to fit in culturally.

I'm not saying that you have to change who you are or how you act or think, but understanding the organizational culture and figuring out where you fit in this ecosystem can be very beneficial as you onboard yourself.

<-----Do you have all the right tools to do your job? ----->
<-----Do you understand the issues that the company, industry, and competition have? ----->
<-----Also, do I understand the company's structure? Who has what roles, who has what power, and things like that.
----->
Gaining an understanding of these things is part of the process of personal onboarding.

#### Leaving Your Last Job the Right Way

Leaving a position well leaves a favorable impression of your work with your manager, team, and customers.

â€¦most of the jobs you will find in the future will be found through the network of people you are working with today.

<-----Keep your brand and your name intact.----->

So how do we "leave well? " Well here's two ideas that can be very powerful.

<-----First, get the tasks out of your head and onto a to do list.----->

What are the things that you need to do, the things that have to happen, so that you can effectively and appropriately severe the relationship with your last company or your last role.

<-----Then, agree with your manager on who will do what.----->

### 30/60/90 Day Plan and Tips to be Proactive

#### Introduction to 30/60/90 Day Plans

In this module we're going to talk about the idea of having a 30, 60 or 90 day plan.

a lot of this planning stuff can be boiled down to two things, 
(1) make a 90 day plan, which is what we're going over in the next few videos, and 
(2) communicate.

I think it's critical that you have great communication.

This includes listening and learning and observing.

<-----It also includes letting other people understand what you do and what you're willing to do.----->

Having good communication can be critical for the first 90 days.

#### 30 Day Plan

The purpose of the first 30 days is to learn about 
<-----the company, 
industry, 
services, 
who the competition is, 
what the organization structure is, 
office politics, 
more about your role, 
etcetera.----->

This is a time when people expect you to ask questions.

During this first 30 days you're probably going to get introductions to other people in the company, especially people on your team.

I encourage you to take notes shortly after you do this.

This can help you remember people names and also understand where they fit in in the organization.

<-----Ask questions to understand who your customers are.----->

These might be internal customers, but also understand who the paying customers of the company are.

There are different types of internal customers, your boss is your internal customer.

Other people in other divisions might be internal customers.

<-----Understand who you do work for.----->

That is identify strengths and weaknesses that your company has as well as other companies, which are essentially your competitors, and identify opportunities and threats.

Towards the end of the first 30 days 

<-----Ask the boss to sit down with you and talk about things like what is your role.----->
<-----Ask them to help you understand what your role is.----->

Your role might be different than what the job description was.

You also want to understand what their goals are for you.

<-----What's the future of the company and the department.----->

<-----your boss can help you understand more of what they expect from you.----->

<-----Also do an analysis of the products and services that your company offers, both internal products and services and external products and services.----->

Another important thing to do in the first 30 days is to understand 
<-----how people communicate.----->

What are their preferences and what systems are available.

<-----Communication is going to be a big part of your job.----->

Also, this is a great opportunity to understand and start to define 
<-----what the culture of the company is.----->

I have a good understanding of 
<-----
why my company exists, 
how we got to where we are, 
what are goals are, and 
how my department and my role contribute to the future of the company.
----->

#### 60 Day Plan

<-----map out of the projects that you're aware of.----->

<-----Are they projects just for yourself----->
<-----are they team projects?----->
<-----What impact will these projects have on the company, on your customers, on the bottom or top line of the company, et cetera? ----->
<-----where you're spending your time.----->

<-----look for some personal wins.----->

<-----Also, define how others perceive you.----->

How do you think others talk about you? What value do they see in you? Where do you compliment them? Do you threaten them? I encourage you to 

<-----write down how you think your coworkers and other people in the organization perceive you.----->

<-----I would try and look for and identify leadership and volunteer opportunities that you can fill right now or that are left unfilled.----->

At this point you're simply identifying a need.

You're not saying that you're going to do it, but you're 

<-----identifying something that you might want to step into in the future.----->

By the end of these 60 days what does it look like? Here's an example.

<-----People know who I am,-----> 
<-----I've settled into my role, ----->
that is I'm doing what I was hired to do and people recognize my expertise and specialties,
<-----I understand my department goals and projects and I am making progress.----->

Of course, I have all of my tools set up and I am productive.

By this point we're settling in comfortably and we have a much better idea of what's expected of us and how we can make an impact.


#### 90 Day Plan

<-----does it make sense for you to gain additional skills? Where are the opportunities to improve?----->

<-----meet with your boss for an informal review and for feedback.----->

<-----Define your accomplishments.----->

<-----What are the opportunities that you should or you want to work on, even if they are really big and crazy.----->

<-----
Are you reinforcing their message and helping them? 
What can you do to contribute to the company culture? 
what you think you were hired for
how you actually get those things done.
----->

<-----I understand the company's goals, objectives, and vision and mission statement.----->

<-----I know my place.----->

<-----I know where I can contribute and I know what the opportunities are for me here.----->

<-----We're talking about a long term relationship with a great company and a great opportunity and you having a significant role in the future of the company.----->
