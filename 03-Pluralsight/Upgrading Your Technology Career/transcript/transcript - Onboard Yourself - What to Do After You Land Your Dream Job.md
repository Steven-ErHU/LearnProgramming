Taking Ownership in Your Job
Course Introduction

Welcome to the new course Onboard Yourself: What to Do after you Land Your Dream Job.

My name is Jason Alba.

I've done a number of career courses for Pluralsight.

I'm excited about this course because it's what you do after you land your job.

It's not all the build-up of looking for a job, finding openings, interviewing, networking, all of those things to help you land your job.

It's what you do after you land your job.

I was very careful about naming this course, Onboard Yourself.

That's because onboarding has traditional meanings within a company, the bigger the company the more formal the onboarding is.

I found some definitions on onboarding online, one of them was organizational socialization.

That sounds like some really cool jargon that HR came up with.

I think what they're trying to say here is they're trying to get a new employee socialized within the company or the organization.

Let's dig a little deeper.

The definition says that onboarding has a purpose of helping new employees acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and behaviors to become effective organizational members and insiders.

Now when we're hired to do technical things like programming or networking or something like that, we should already have the knowledge and skills and probably behaviors to become effective in the organization and our department or division.

That's what we were hired for.

I think this is a great philosophical idea of what onboarding is, but I want to take it to a whole 'nother level.

Before we can do that, I need to define what traditional onboarding has looked like.

Usually its list after list after list of things that we're supposed to do so that we can fit into our department.

This usually involves filling out the right paperwork, signing forms so we can get paid, getting our email account set up, having an office space and a computer and a chair.

It might seem pretty obvious to you that this is all part of getting a job, but it's not uncommon to get hired at a company, big or small, and they're not ready for you the day that you get there.

Traditionally onboarding is that list of things that the company needs to do to make sure that you can sit down at your desk and do the best job possible.

It really has nothing to do with your skills or how you're fitting into the company, more than anything it's become a checklist of what HR makes sure that we need to do so that we have all the paperwork in place.

The higher level that I want to take it in this course is to onboard yourself.

I'm not talking about the list of things that HR needs you to do or the list of things that your boss needs you to do so they know that you're ready to do your job.

I'm talking about taking personal ownership of your future at the company.

If you successfully onboard yourself you should be a valued member of the team.

Of course, you're going to contribute to the company and do what you were hired to do.

Onboarding yourself helps you get there faster and have a better presence and brand within the company.

It also helps establish your brand so that people know who you are, what you're capable of, and even how you can help them.
Related Career Courses

I want to share some related courses in the Pluralsight library.

You know there are a lot of technical courses to help you become a better technologist.

Did you know there's a growing collection of career courses? Here are courses that should interest you j after you land your job.

Some of these are mine.

Some of them are from other authors.

If you search Pluralsight for careers you should find the list that includes these courses.

The first three I'll talk about have to do with general career management.

Career Management 2.

0, Career Survival Strategies, How to Build Your Career.

There are also courses on leadership and management as well as multiple courses on productivity.

Once you land your job make sure you don't make a mistake by having poor email communication.

I love the course Effective Email Communication to help you write better, more concise, stronger emails.

Also you'll probably do a fair amount of networking after you land your job.

How do you keep track of it? The same way a sales person keeps track of their prospects and customers, with a CRM tool.

Look for my CRM and Relationship Management course to help you understand what you should track and how you could track it.

There are courses to help you become a better communicator.

There are multiple courses on public speaking and presentations.

You might not think of yourself as a presenter or a public speaker, but polishing these skills might help you down the road.

After all, we'll all in the business of selling our skills and even our projects.

Whether you're making a presentation to one person or 1000 people, these courses can help you make those presentations better.

Within your organization you'll probably have to pitch ideas and make suggestions.

There's a course to help you do that more effectively.

Informational interviews is a tactic that a lot of job seekers use to help them get a real interview and network into a company.

Just because you've landed your dream job doesn't mean that you should stop asking for informational interviews.

As a matter of fact, it should be easier now to get and do informational interviews now that you have a business card and a title.

Finally, there's a course of developing a killer personal brand as well as learning how to use LinkedIn better.

As I mentioned earlier, go to Pluralsight and search for careers.

You'll find a number of videos that are helpful whether you're in a job search or you're currently working.
Whose Responsibility is It?

Usually when you start a new job you're the new kid on the block.

You don't know anything, you don't know anybody, you don't know the norms within an organization.

You show up at the right place and the right time and hope that there is somebody there to kind of hold your hand and guide you through the process of getting started.

Where's your desk? Who are the others on the team? Things like that.

This is part of the onboarding process and it's okay that you're not in charge of this part.

The company is going to help you take responsibility to get onboarded.

As I mentioned earlier, there are checklists that HR and your boss will have that help them make sure that you're onboarded successfully.

That's okay.

Let them do their job.

Let them help you.

Learn from them and do everything they need you to do quickly.

As you go through the rest of this course I want you to think about this, your boss will expect you to take ownership in certain parts of the onboarding process.

I'm not talking about the checklist from HR and the stuff that your boss has to do and report back to their boss, I'm talking about what you do to make sure you fit in in your organization.

How do you hand the projects that are assigned to you? Are you friendly and nice to other people? Are you a good cultural fit? There are a number of things that the company, HR and your boss, is going to walk you through, but your boss is going to continue watching you to see if they hired the right person.

Of course, your technically competent, you've been trained and you passed the interview process and beat out other people.

Now they're looking to see if you're pleasant to work with and are going to cause problems at the office politics level.

Let's make sure that we're taking responsibility to fit in the way that our boss is hoping that we'll fit in.
Traditional Onboarding vs.

Personal Onboarding

The idea of personal onboarding isn't something that you'll easily learn about by online searches or in books.

Nobody's really talking about it.

If you go research onboarding you're going to learn about all the traditional stuff.

Let's get this whole idea of traditional onboarding out of the way and push it aside.

In order to do that, we'll make some distinctions between traditional onboarding and personal onboarding.

Traditionally you'll deal with things like making sure you have all the right paperwork and have signed all the right forms.

You have access to the building or whatever offices you need access to.

You have a desk and a seat and a computer.

Some companies will have a company profile or a yammer account or internal social network or something like that.

IT will make sure you have all the right passwords and whatever else they need you to have in order to consider you ready to hit the ground running and do the job that you were hired for.

Contrast that with things that we're looking for in the personal onboarding column.

For example, can I do my job? If I can't do my job, what are the things that I need? Do I need my role redefined or better defined? Do I need certain tools? Do I need other tools that the company didn't think of? Maybe there are tools, techniques, or ideas that I learned in previous companies that would be greatly beneficial in this organization.

Do I fit in culturally? It's always weird to be the new person in the organization.

You have to find out what the pecking order is.

You have to find out how things work within your division.

It can be shocking to find out how much power your boss does or doesn't have within the organization.

You need to develop a strategy to help you figure out how to fit in culturally.

I'm not saying that you have to change who you are or how you act or think, but understanding the organizational culture and figuring out where you fit in this ecosystem can be very beneficial as you onboard yourself.

Do you have all the right tools to do your job? Do you understand the issues that the company, industry, and competition have? Also, do I understand the company's structure? Who has what roles, who has what power, and things like that.

Gaining an understanding of these things is part of the process of personal onboarding.
Leaving Your Last Job the Right Way

As I was putting together information for this course I pulled out a book called, I've Landed My Dream Job, Now What? This is a book written by Scot Herrick.

Scot has worked in massive organizations.

He talks about the idea of what to do in the first 30 days of your job, but before he goes into any 30 day plan he wants to make sure that you left your last company in a good place.

Sometimes we're inclined to walk away from our last company and want nothing to do with them.

Here are a couple quotes from Scot that helped me understand how important it is to leave your last company on a good note.

He says, "Leaving a position well leaves a favorable impression of your work with your manager, team, and customers.

…most of the jobs you will find in the future will be found through the network of people you are working with today.

" In this quote Scot talks about future job opportunities.

I want to broaden that idea.

What if you don't leave your company well? What if you leave a big mess and you say, hey this is your problem, I'm out of here.

Later on, your new company might have an opportunity to work with your old company.

Now we're not talking about future jobs that you are going to find, we're talking about business relationships between two organizations.

If you left your last role a mess, that will have an impact on your brand.

It probably won't be a good impact.

I want people to think that I'm a person of integrity.

I'm someone who does what I say I would do and someone who's fund to work with.

Can you imagine if you left a mess for your managers, team, or customers and because of that they decide not to do a business relationship with your new customer.

Keep your brand and your name intact.

Scot also says that you want to leave your position well because if you don't you might have distractions coming from your last manager, your team, or even the customers that you used to serve.

He says, "Leaving well will lessen those distractions as you ramp up your work in the new position.

" Can you image trying to start your new job not dictated getting emails and phone calls from people that you used to work with, asking for information on how you did something or why something might not be working the way they think it should work.

That would be a horrible distraction.

You have a hard enough time trying to figure out the new company and what your role is and onboarding yourself without having people from the last company contacting you to ask you questions that you might have already forgotten the answers to.

Scot says that a way to do that is to define what done means.

He says, "…unless you define what 'done' means with your old manager and coworkers, you can't confidently push back on their work requests if they continually ask you to do stuff from your old job.

" Now of course, you might have consulting opportunities if they continually ask you to do stuff from your old job.

But if we're not talking about monetary compensation or you don't want to do the stuff anymore, make sure that you've defined what done means so that you can go back to them and say, I appreciate the questions you have for me, but I've had to move on to to this new role.

That's what he means when he says that you can confidently push back on their work requests.

I'm not talking about being mean or being a jerk or being unethical.

I'm talking about defining what the end is, what done means, so that you, your manager, and your coworkers from the last company can all understand that you are done with that role and they need to figure it out from there on.
How to Transition out of Your Last Job

So how do we "leave well? " Well here's two ideas that can be very powerful.

First, get the tasks out of your head and onto a to do list.

What are the things that you need to do, the things that have to happen, so that you can effectively and appropriately severe the relationship with your last company or your last role.

Write those down.

No task is too small.

No task is too big.

Put every single task that's in your head into a to do list.

It doesn't mean that you're going to do the tasks or be responsible for the tasks, but it will help people understand what needs to happen.

Then, agree with your manager on who will do what.

What is it that you're going to do and what it is that other people are going to do? This is a formal process where you show your manager the list of things that need to happen.

You can simply say, I'll do these two, but the other tasks really are more appropriate for so and so or my replacement, or something like that.

Scot says, "…this agreement allows you to push back on further requests to help out on your old job once you are in your new position.

" You've identified the work to do, those are the written tasks, you did your part and transitioned the other parts to other people and your manager agreed with that plan.

That means it is your old manager's problem, not yours.

Isn't that a great way to go out? Having your manager understand what needs to happen to effectively have you transition out of that role? What a gift to them.

They don't have to figure it out once you're gone, you've already told them what the transition plan looks like.

Even if you don't take ownership of any of the tasks on the list, you've created the list and helped them understand what needs to happen.

As a manager I would love it if I had a list like that to help me transition somebody out of my organization.

Now you're ready to walk away from this role and know that your integrity is intact and your brand should be positively strong with the people that you used to work with.

There's less of a reason for them to not do a deal with you in your new organization.
Wrap-up

Before we move into module 2 where we'll talk about the 30, 60, and 90 day plan, let's make sure we understand what we talked about in this module.

We talked about understanding what personal onboarding is, owning that personal onboarding, and making sure that you left your last company or job well.

HR has their own list of what onboarding means to them.

Help them check off the things on their list, but realize that you have your own distinct responsibilities in personal onboarding.

Take ownership of what you need to do and your role in that.

Make sure you left your last company well.

This means that you've defined what it means to be done and communicated that with the people that you worked with.

It also means that you're allowing yourself to start your new role well.

There are no skeletons in the closet.

There are no past projects that you have to take care of.

Additionally, we talked about making sure that you're not only tech-savvy, but career-savvy with the other courses in the Pluralsight library.

These include courses on communication, project management, doing presentations, networking, and a number of other things to help you be better at owning your own career management.
30/60/90 Day Plan and Tips to be Proactive
Introduction to 30/60/90 Day Plans

In this module we're going to talk about the idea of having a 30, 60 or 90 day plan.

We're also going to talk about ideas and tips to help you be more proactive as you onboard yourself.

Thirty, 60, and 90 plans are interesting ideas.

Typically you're going to hear about these types of plans for people in leadership roles, especially executives who are coming in to guide the company in a different direction.

We can borrow on the concept of 30, 60, and 90 plans for us, whether we're in a strategic role or not.

We'll talk about specific objects or purposes, tasks or things that you do, and achievements or what it's going to look like by the end of the 30, 60, or 90 days.

The ideas I present in this module might be perfect for you or there might be a few things missing.

I encourage you to take notes during the next few videos and come up with what you think is the most appropriate 30, 60, and 90 day action plan for you and your company.

As I was doing research for this course, I came across a book to help you get up and running in the first 90 days.

I found a really interesting comment in the Amazon review.

In short it said, a lot of this planning stuff can be boiled down to two things, (1) make a 90 day plan, which is what we're going over in the next few videos, and (2) communicate.

I think it's critical that you have great communication.

This includes listening and learning and observing.

It also includes letting other people understand what you do and what you're willing to do.

Having good communication can be critical for the first 90 days.
30 Day Plan

Let's start off with the first 30 days.

This could be your 30 day plan.

The purpose of the first 30 days is to learn about the company, industry, services, who the competition is, what the organization structure is, office politics, more about your role, etcetera.

There are a lot of things to learn about in these first 30 days.

This is a time when you're going to ask a lot of questions and do a lot of listening.

There might be opportunities for some important wins, whether big or small, but use the first 30 days as a ramp up period to learn.

This is a time when people expect you to ask questions.

You're not there to rock the boat and you don't want that to be the first impression that people have of you.

Here are some specific tasks that you might do in the first 30 days.

We've talked about the traditional onboarding stuff.

This is the stuff that your boss and HR are going to help you through and walk you through.

This is their checklist.

Make sure this goes as smoothly as possible.

Move through all of the stuff that you need to including any mandatory training as quickly as possible to get it out of the way.

During this first 30 days you're probably going to get introductions to other people in the company, especially people on your team.

I encourage you to take notes shortly after you do this.

This can help you remember people names and also understand where they fit in in the organization.

Ask questions to understand who your customers are.

These might be internal customers, but also understand who the paying customers of the company are.

There are different types of internal customers, your boss is your internal customer.

Other people in other divisions might be internal customers.

Understand who you do work for.

The first 30 days is a great time to do what they call a SWOT analysis.

That is identify strengths and weaknesses that your company has as well as other companies, which are essentially your competitors, and identify opportunities and threats.

Doing this type of industry analysis helps you understand the power of your company and the opportunities or problems your company might have compared with your competition.

Towards the end of the first 30 days I would encourage you to meet with your boss.

This is not a formal meeting, although it's also not an informal meeting.

Ask the boss to sit down with you and talk about things like what is your role.

Ask them to help you understand what your role is.

Your role might be different than what the job description was.

You also want to understand what their goals are for you.

What's the future of the company and the department.

Now that you're not an outsider, there might be information that you didn't know about before and your boss can help you understand more of what they expect from you.

Also do an analysis of the products and services that your company offers, both internal products and services and external products and services.

Of course, you can go down to marketing and get the glossy brochures to see what they think that you offer, but find out what people within the company think about your products and services.

They probably already know the competition offers and how you stack up.

Try and find out what the market says about your products and services.

Another important thing to do in the first 30 days is to understand how people communicate.

What are their preferences and what systems are available.

Communication is going to be a big part of your job.

Whether you are clarifying specs and what people need from you or you're delivering final products to them, are people expecting you to communicate within an internal social network, through email, through text messaging, through chat, face to face, on the phone.

Different people are going to have different preferences.

Find out what people prefer and how they respond best.

Also, this is a great opportunity to understand and start to define what the culture of the company is.

Understanding the culture can really help you fit you into the company.

I want you to think about what it looks like by the end of the 30 days.

Here's an idea of what that might be.

I have a good understanding of why my company exists, how we got to where we are, what are goals are, and how my department and my role contribute to the future of the company.

I know my coworkers and am meeting others in the company, my customers and other important people.

These first 30 days can be mentally exhausting.

Doing the things that I share with you in this video can prepare you for a strong start at your new company.
60 Day Plan

Let's move on to the next 30 days.

This is really a part of your 60 day plan.

Here's an example of this time period, to transition from learning and observing, which you did in the first 30 days, to injecting your skills and your talents.

You're contributing, now that you understand the landscape better.

Here are some examples of specific tasks that you might do in the 31-60 day period.

After a few weeks of being in your job you might want to redefine what your role is.

You should have a different perspective after working in the company for a few weeks.

Also, map out of the projects that you're aware of.

Do you have a few weeks of projects, a few months of projects, or are you working on projects that are years out? Are they projects just for yourself or are they team projects? What impact will these projects have on the company, on your customers, on the bottom or top line of the company, et cetera? Get an understanding of the projects that you're working on and where you're spending your time.

I encourage you to look for some personal wins.

These are wins within the company that people will start to take note of.

By now you should have an idea of a few problems that have you scratching your head wondering, why don't they do it this way, it would be so easy to make the change.

It might make sense to approach your boss and get permission to move forward on those.

I don't think you should always do that because you don't want to come across as too aggressive or a busy body or a know it all, but it would be great if you can get some wins to be associated with your name and your brand.

Also, define how others perceive you.

How do you think others talk about you? What value do they see in you? Where do you compliment them? Do you threaten them? I encourage you to write down how you think your coworkers and other people in the organization perceive you.

I would try and look for and identify leadership and volunteer opportunities that you can fill right now or that are left unfilled.

At this point you're simply identifying a need.

You're not saying that you're going to do it, but you're identifying something that you might want to step into in the future.

What are the other things that you should be doing in days 31-60? Make sure that the work that you're doing is having an impact on your brand and making your boss looking good.

By the end of these 60 days what does it look like? Here's an example.

People know who I am, I've settled into my role, that is I'm doing what I was hired to do and people recognize my expertise and specialties, I understand my department goals and projects and I am making progress.

Of course, I have all of my tools set up and I am productive.

By this point we're settling in comfortably and we have a much better idea of what's expected of us and how we can make an impact.
90 Day Plan

The beginning of the third month is the last part of your 90 day plan.

The purpose of this might be to proactively identify future strategy and your role within the company.

Where can you add value? How do you want to be known or positioned? What improvements do you want to work on for yourself? Let's talk about specific tasks.

This is a great time to access the skills that you have compared to the skills that are needed to do certain things.

Of course, 2 months ago you were hired for your skills.

Now that you understands the needs of the company and your department better, does it make sense for you to gain additional skills? Where are the opportunities to improve? Also, meet with your boss for an informal review and for feedback.

I know we just talked about this for the first 30 days, but this is a great time to do it again.

Define your accomplishments.

This is something that you're going to do in a job journal.

You're going to write this down.

You're going to document it.

It's going to come in handy later and we'll talk about that in module 3.

In the book, Good to Great, Jim Collins talks about this thing called BHAGs or Big Hairy Audacious Goals.

What are the opportunities that you should or you want to work on, even if they are really big and crazy.

A lot of people might think that they are unachievable, but if you do achieve them they can have a huge impact on your company or you or your projects.

What are these BHAGs that you might want to tackle? Can you identify volunteer opportunities and needs that are outside of your department or even other projects? In other words, there might be other customers within the company that you should be catering to.

By now, you should be able to define how you are contributing to the company culture.

Not just going to work and expecting them to give you things and you're just trying to fit in, but how do you compliment and contribute to that culture? Culture is something that executives spend a lot of time building and talking about.

Are you reinforcing their message and helping them? What can you do to contribute to the company culture? In Scot Herrick's book, I've Landed my Dream Job, Now What, he talks about the different between the job description, which is what you think you were hired for, and the work flow, which is how you actually get those things done.

He defines three parts of a work flow, what are in the inputs.

In other words, what do people give you, like requirements or tools.

What do you do with those or what are your actions.

This is a big part of your job.

And finally, what are the outputs? How do you deliver the deliverables to them? In his book he talks about defining work flows and it sounds very complicated because there could be a lot of what ifs and different scenarios that don't fit into a certain mold, but if you can identify inputs and outputs and what you do in between, I think that can help you define what you're real job is and have a better handle on how you're going to be working from here on out.

Scot also suggests that you take time to followup on your old job and renew those relationships.

We're not talking about going back and asking how projects were and if there's anything you can do for them, but just make real interpersonal connections with the people that you used to work with.

You never know when those relationships are going to come in handy.

By the end of the 90 days, what does it look like? What's the vision for that end? Here's an example of what it could be.

I understand the company's goals, objectives, and vision and mission statement.

I know my place.

I know where I can contribute and I know what the opportunities are for me here.

I am actively working towards long term goals while ensuring the job I was hired to do is getting done.

I am known to be methodical and strategic and purposeful with the way that I do my job.

Can you see how the goals and tasks and the vision can help you launch yourself into your new career much more effectively than if you just sit down and do your job.

We're talking about a long term relationship with a great company and a great opportunity and you having a significant role in the future of the company.

That's the purpose of the 30, 60, and 90 day plans.
Onboarding Tips From Peter Osborne

In these next few videos I want to share some ideas that I got from people in my network.

You can look all of these people up on LinkedIn to learn more about them and find their websites.

Peter Osborne is a senior executive in the Philadelphia area.

His consulting business is called Bulldog Management Solutions.

Here are some great quotes that I got from him.

He says, "resist the urge to make changes from Day One.

" A lot of times we're going to come in and think, man it's really stupid how they do things here, I want to change so many things.

Resist that urge.

He says, "I think the most important thing is to first understand or create a vision that is simple, focusing more on defining the mission rather than the tactics.

" In other words, get a big picture understanding of what's going on and what you need to do.

Peter continues, "spend time getting answers to some core questions such as: How can I help you? What should we stop doing? What should we start doing? What's the best idea this group has had where better execution would have made a huge difference in our success? " He says, "bring everyone together asking each person to bring the best practice from inside or outside the company.

Discuss all the ideas in a safe environment.

" Finally, Peter suggests, "as a group prioritize the ideas in two ways, easy and fast execution or long/hard execution, and low impact or high impact, and then decide which you're going to tackle first and which ones can go on the back burner.

" I think Peter shares these ideas with management and executives.

Even if you're not in management or an executive, these are great ideas to help you understand what's happening in the organization and where there are opportunities for improvement.
Onboarding Tips From Nicola James

Nicola James has some great ideas for you on getting started in a new company.

She's the managing partner of Thomas Brooke International, which is a recruiting and consulting firm.

Again, you can learn more about her by searching for her on LinkedIn.

Nicola says, "taking ownership from day one" and she is specifically talking about taking ownership of the onboarding process "is so important because without it you are leaving your fate in the hands of the company process, which can be a stumbling block to your success.

" In other words, no matter what the company has set up for onboarding, make sure you are serious about you getting started.

She says, "there are three types of people in the world: (1) those who make it happen; (2) those who watch it happen; and (3) those who say, 'what happened? '" When we talk about personal onboarding we're talking about the first type, those who make it happen.

Nicola adds, "figure out the real org chart.

In other words, not what HR gives you, but where the power really resides and who really makes everything happen.

Make this a priority.

" Understanding where the power is and who makes the decisions and who has influence is critical.

You might be given a project from somebody who seems to have power on the org chart, but that might be trumped by somebody else who really has the power.

Nicola continues, "figure out the political landscape as soon as possible.

There are always politics.

You don't need to play the game, but you do need to be smart enough to not get burned before you have established independent credibility.

" The independent credibility happens after your role has settled in.

It's after all the first impressions might have been proven wrong.

Suggesting that you understand the politics, not playing the game, but understanding how things work, is a great idea.

Nicola says, "research company products and services, independently, and how they are perceived in the market.

You probably did this before interviewing, but now more than ever, learn as much as you can.

" In addition to the questions that Peter said to ask, she has a few other questions.

What do we as a company do well? What have we historically not done well? Are there are any recent glowing successes or painful black eyes to be aware of when I make new suggestions? Additionally, she says, what specific things do you most want me to accomplish successfully in my first year on the job? What do you not want me to do? And what did my predecessor do well and what did they do that I should not repeat? Nicola is talking about a lot of the questions that you should be asking in those first 30 days when you are asking questions and simply listening to the answers.

This is your opportunity to learn and these are great examples of questions to help you learn.
Onboarding Tips From Christine Dennison

Chris Dennison is a friend and a career coach.

Look her up on LinkedIn, Christine Dennison, or look her website, the jobsearchcoach.

com.

She has some great suggestions including, "if you've ever wanted to drop any bad habits, try a new approach or change your image, now is the time to do it.

" This new job is an opportunity for a fresh start.

If you know there is something you want to change, do it now.

Even if it feels a little uncomfortable.

Chris continues, get to know the corporate culture.

Be observant of the style of the organization.

Does everyone put everything in writing or nothing in writing? Are there meetings all day or no meetings at all? Are you expected to operate independently or do you have to get everything approved? Understanding how things work in the organization will help you as you try and move forward with your projects.

Chris says, pay attention to the grapevine.

Be a good listener, but not a gossip or rumor-spreader.

Be willing to share facts.

Become known as a good, reliable, honest source.

Being tapped into the unofficial line of communication is a critical part of getting things done.

Chris is talking about two different things here, one is understanding how information flows through the organization and where you can find what's really happening.

The other is what your brand is.

She says, become known as a good, reliable, honest source.

This happens as you are careful on what you communicate to others.

She says, "find out how your boss likes to communicate.

Because a key part of your job is to make your boss successful.

You will want to get off to a good start by establishing an effective pattern of communication.

" Finally, Chris says, "include stress-reducing activities in your new routine.

Expect to spend extra time at work in the beginning to be able to absorb all that new information quickly.

Don't get trapped into a burnout level of performance.

You will be most productive, creative, and happy if you take the time to clear your head every day.

" She continued, whether that's with yoga or spending time with family or friends or on a hobby, I totally agree with this suggestion.

Starting a new job can be really stressful.

You're probably going to go into sensory overload.

Meeting new people, having new expectations, trying to learn new systems, can be very stressful.

Make sure you schedule time in and have those stress reducing activities.
Onboarding Tips From Kathy Simmons

Kathy Simmons is the CEO of Netshare.

Netshare is an executive networking group.

She has seen a lot of transitions happen.

She says, "personal onboarding is a great topic considering how much time is spent on making the best hire and the high number of executive candidates who do not work out in the first 18 months.

" This is not limited just to executive candidates.

People who don't fit in culturally and don't understand what their role is might be perceived as a hiring failure.

Don't let this be you.

Kathy continues, "it's smart to know who, if anyone in your department, were potential candidates for the position you were hired for and reach out to them.

" You don't want to start off this new role with bad blood and people that are jealous that you go the job and they didn't.
Onboarding Tips From Rod Colon

Finally some thoughts from my friend in New Jersey, career management advocate, coach, radio host, Rod Colon.

Learn more about him on LinkedIn.

Rod says, "even after being hired by your target company, you are still (and will remain) the CEO of ME, Inc.

In that lifelong position, you must not relinquish the duties of managing your career.

" I know it gets tempting that once you land your dream job you kind of hang a lot of this stuff up and don't do career management anymore.

I encourage you to not do that.

You are, and always will be, the CEO of ME, Inc.

Rod says, "manage your new relationships; nurture them with the idea that they will lead you to other relationships.

In every case, connect with them on LinkedIn.

" Now, I totally agree with the idea of manage your new relationships.

I even made a course about this on Pluralsight about using a CRM to manage the relationships.

I am a strong advocate of that.

I'm not necessary a strong advocate of always connecting with people on LinkedIn.

I like the idea that you connect with a lot of people, especially people that are relevant to you, on LinkedIn, but I wouldn't say that you always in every case connect with them on LinkedIn.

Rod continues, "explore the hidden job market to gather business intelligence, discover market conditions, and spot trends in your industry.

" The hidden job market is simply understanding who's hiring.

We're not talking about what's posted on Monster and Indeed.

We're talking about what managers in your company and other companies that you're developing relationships with.

We want to know what the openings are.

Openings mean there are problems to solve and opportunities to fill.

The idea of exploring the hidden job market basically means keeping your ear to the ground, understand what's happening in the industry.
Wrap-up

Let's take a minute to wrap up the things that we've talked about in this module.

We're talking about owning the personal onboarding experience for the first 30, 60, 90 days and then some.

We want to ask and then we want to listen, understand.

We want to seek and find knowledge and gain perspective from other people.

This is not a time to come in and tell everybody how smart we are, it's a time to understand what we can from other people.

You've heard more than once that the organizational chart and the politics might be different than what's in the documentation.

Find out where the power lies and who the real leaders and influencers are.

In the first 30 days we're focusing a lot on observing and learning.

In the next 30 days we're figuring out how we fit in and how we can settle into our role.

In the last 30 days we're preparing to be forward thinking and planning the impact that we can have on our role and the organization.

In any of these 30, 60, and 90 day segments we talk about what the purpose is, what specific tasks or action items are, and what the vision is.

By the time we're done with each of those periods, what does it look like? What have we accomplished? As we mentioned in the Amazon review, communication is critical.

Make sure that you are communicating correctly with your coworkers, your customers, and especially your boss.

Finally, you are the CEO of Me, inc, even if you have a different title from another company, as you own being CEO of ME, inc you will add value to your company and you'll definitely add value to yourself.

Let's move on to the next module.
Beyond the 90 Day Plan
Introduction to the First Year Plan

Welcome to module 3 of Onboard Yourself.

By this time in the course you have a great idea of personal ownership in the onboarding process.

We're talking about something completely different than what HR is going to do with and for you and rather how you can set yourself up to have an awesome career at your job or your new company.

The 30, 60, and 90 day plan, you got it down, you're good.

What do we do now? Let's focus on what happens after the first 90 days.

I'd like you to think about what your goals are for year 1.

What are your goals regarding your network? Are there certain people that you want to have a stronger relationship with? Do you want to grow your network outside of the company and be better known within the industry? What about your personal brand? How do you want to be known and how will that impact your career management? Further, what do you want your role to be in the company? Maybe it's time to looking at having a bigger role or more responsibility.

And finally, how are you positioning yourself for the future? Whether it's within the company or somewhere else.

Everything that we're doing in this first year will have an impact on all of these things.

It can accelerate the direction you're headed or it can cause your career to stagnate a little bit.

What are the things that we should do to help you with your network and your brand and your future in the first year? That's what we're going to talk about this module.

Let's get started.
Creating Systems to Stay on Track

One of the most important things to help you in your one year and beyond plan is going to be the systems that you create.

In the career management course we talked about this idea from Kathy Loveless where she said "create the system and then honor the system.

" In the early days of your new job I'm sure you're overwhelmed, but you're also excited about doing all of the right things.

This is a great chance to get a fresh start, to start over.

You don't have any baggage with the company.

So you create a system and you think, okay in the next year I'm going to do all these things and accomplish all those things.

The problem is as the weeks and the months go by you might get complacent with your systems or you might get distracted by other things, things that are still good, but they take you away from your end goal of what you want to accomplish within that first year.

Let me encourage you to create systems that will help you achieve what you want to achieve in the first year.

Of course, you can be flexible in what you do and you can change things and take things out and add things, whatever you need to do.

But if you create a system to help you achieve these goals, in 6 or 8 months when it seems unimportant, don't go away from the system.

Specifically I'm talking about a calendar system and a system to help you with tasks, whether they are repeat or one time tasks.

This could be something as simple as a corporate calendaring system, whether it's outlook or a gmail base system or it could be your own personal calendaring system.

The calendaring system is a great way for you to say, I want to have a meeting the first of every month or every quarter with my boss and then you don't forget to do it because you're prompted by your calendar system.

Don't underestimate the power of honoring the system.

I know how easy it is to create something and be excited about what it could and should look like over the next 12 months and then walk away from the system after you feel like you have it under control.

Have room for flexibility of course, but if you have long term objectives and goals you're the only one that's going to care about it, even if nobody else in the department or company is doing these things, you need to be in charge of your own career management.

Speaking of objectives, write down what your objectives are.

Why are you doing these things? What's the overall purpose? Some people put these in a vision statement or a mission statement.

Having these objectives defined helps you understand why you are doing something in month 9 when it doesn't seem like it has any purpose.

You can go back and look at your objective and say, I've actually been doing this once a quarter for the last three quarters and I need to keep doing it.

Doing it will help me accomplish this or these objectives.

Once you've defined your high level objectives, which might include preparing for a promotion, having more responsibility, broadening your skill set, getting a raise, any of those things, let's define specific goals.

The goals are going to be the stepping stones to help you meet the objectives.

These are the things that are likely going to end up in your calendar and your task systems.

In other modules on Pluralsight we've talked about having smart goals.

These are specific and measurable and accomplishable and all of those things.

An example of a goal might be to meet with your manager once a quarter or to write down your weekly or monthly accomplishments every week or every month.

Write down your specific goals and create a path to help you reach the objectives that you have defined.

And then use your system to make sure you do those consistently.

One of the things that I would suggest is to schedule time to meet with yourself and stay on track.

For example, the idea of meeting with yourself once a week or once a month to keep track of what your accomplishments were in that time period is really powerful.

We'll talk about where those accomplishments come in later, but you're really doing is taking time to debrief your week or your month.

What did you do right? What are things that you're proud of? What are things that you got recognized for? Where are opportunities for improvement? Having these regular meetings with yourself can help you make improvements and meet your objectives.
Making Continuing Education a Reality

Let's talk about continuing education.

Everybody seems to be impressed if we go back to school and take a few courses or try and finish our college degree or something like that.

I love the idea of continuing education, especially as we take personal ownership and responsibility in educating ourselves.

Pluralsight is a terrific resource for you to continue your education.

I'm not necessarily talking about getting a degree or an advanced degree or even certifications.

You might have come into Pluralsight specifically to get better at one specific technology, language, process, or technique.

Let's dive into the value of continuing your education.

In the first module I talked about the career courses that are available on Pluralsight.

I'm not talking about just job search related courses, there are a number of courses in Pluralsight that can help you with your management, leadership, strategy, process, and other types of things that will help you in your career.

Of course, you'll find courses that will help you get deeper in whatever expertise you already have.

I invite you to visit Pluralsight and watch the courses that you already have expertise in.

You might learn new techniques.

You might get updated on processes or languages, and if nothing else, you might have the satisfaction of knowing that you're already up to par with the other experts that are teaching Pluralsight courses.

Also look to expand your breadth of expertise.

You might have an expertise in one or two languages.

What are other things that you should know about? You probably already have an idea of some of the things that you should be learning or know about and you just haven't had time or much interest in it.

I invite you to expand your breadth and get a broader knowledge base that can compliment what your deep expertise already is.

You might find things that don't have anything to do with your expertise in the breadth and depth department, but you're simply interested and passionate about other things.

Look for those courses, whether they're in Pluralsight or outside of Pluralsight.

As an example, maybe you've been interested in picking up guitar, you might find this to be a terrific hobby that helps you unwind and balance your life a little more.

You might also find correlation and learning opportunities because of this new passion or interest.

I invite you to learn about things that are outside of your comfort zone.

We tend to want to be really good at what we're good at and not have a whole lot of interest in other things.

As you develop your education outside of your comfort zone, it can help you expand your branding and networking opportunities.

One time I was at a meeting at a remote location of my company.

The vice president came in obviously very stressed and he said, I need to play golf, Jason do you play golf? Well I was there to do IT networking and stuff like that.

I had played a couple of games of golf in the past, but I had never enjoyed it and I didn't understand the techniques.

I missed out on a few hours of one on one time with the corporate VP because I did not go outside of my comfort zone prior to that time.

Now, I look for opportunities where I can go outside of my comfort zone, which will help my connect with other people and give me other interests and hobbies.

As you think about your continuing education, look at the learning paths that Pluralsight has put together.

These are a series of suggested courses that help you become expert in a certain area.

Instead of watching one course, the learning paths is a suggestion of five or six courses that help you gain deep and appropriate expertise in that particular thing.

Perhaps you can set a goal to watch one new course each month.

Of course, this will depend on how much time you have, but this is a goal that you might schedule into your calendaring system.
Identifying Networking Venues

Networking is one of the big things that you should continue to do throughout the rest of your career.

Here are a few ideas on where you can network.

First, look for networking opportunities within your company.

I tend to be more introverted and I am okay to pass on the company parties and the company get-togethers.

I don't want to go have water balloon fights and be in a chaotic environment, especially with people that I don't necessarily know.

But these company networking opportunities, whether they are all fun and games or they are structured learning, present a great opportunity to meet new people and start to development relationships with them.

When I go to a networking event that I'm uncomfortable at, which is usually most of the time, it helps me to think that I'm not there to meet everybody and participate in everything, I consider the networking event a success if I meet one or two new people and can have a good conversation with them.

That doesn't mean it has to be along conversation, but it would open the door for future conversations and more relationship development.

Company parties and networking opportunities should be posted on the bulletin boards and online.

Look for them and plan on going to those.

Also, what are the association networking events that you can go to? If you're a project manager look for your local PMP chapter.

I was recently talking to a senior level PMP and I said, are you going to the PMP chapter meetings in your area? He lives in the Washington DC area, which has one of the biggest and most active PMP chapters in the world.

He said he wasn't, but he was planning on it.

He'd been planning on it for many years.

I invite you to find the appropriate associations that you could and should be a member of and attend their meetings regularly.

Don't go just for the food.

Go for the relationships that you can development.

What are special interest groups that have networking events that you can attend? In a recent job I had my CFO was heavily involved in a fundraising charity.

He was on the board of directors in that organization.

I didn't think much of it until I talked to other executives in the community who knew him well.

He was well known in the community, not just because of the things that he did professionally, but because of his interest and involvement and contributions to this special interest charity.

What about industry networking opportunities? Industry networking events give you an opportunity to meet other people in the industry.

You will probably meet your competitors, which is okay.

You'll also likely meet vendors and other people who are somehow associated with your industry.

You never know where these relationships can go.

They can provide great benefit to your company as you expose your company brand to these other organizations and people.

They can also help you understand the industry better and get better relationships and a stronger brand with people inside your industry.

Don't ignore the idea of online networking.

If nothing else, go find one LinkedIn group that you can watch and contribute to.

There are a number of places online that might make sense to participate in.

Just because you've landed your dream job and you're busy, don't ignore other opportunities in the online space.

Finally, look for opportunities to network that are specific to your location.

This might not have anything to do with company, industry, association, special interests, they are simply get-togethers at the neighborhood or community level.

There are a lot of places where you could network.

I hope this has given you an idea of places to look if you can't come up with anything else.
Tips to Network More Effectively

Now that you have an idea of places where you could look for networking opportunities, let's go over some networking tips so you're a more effective networker.

First actively participate.

This was really hard for me.

I love to go and be in the audience.

I want to listen and learn and observe.

When you go to a networking event you could have a goal of, I want to get one real purposeful new relationship out of this networking event, or I want to reconnect with two people that I talked with the last time.

Don't sneak in a few minutes after it starts and sneak out early and say that you were at a networking event networking.

I encourage you to actively participate.

Be present.

Really be there for the relationships.

Also, be known.

Make sure people understand who you are and what you do.

You should define how you want people to perceive you.

When I first started speaking professionally people would say, how do you want me to introduce you? I would say, well you already know who I am, just say you think is right.

I found that was a big mistake.

People would joke about things that I didn't really care about, had nothing to do with my brand, or they would tell a story that was really quite irrelevant.

Finally, I _____wisened up and I wrote a two to three sentence introduction.

When people introduce me now, whether they know me or not, they have a two to three sentence statement that they can read.

And guess what? It's exactly what I want the audience to know about me.

How do you do this? You can work on your own tagline.

In the LinkedIn fundamentals course we talk about your professional headline becoming your tagline.

This goes on your email signature and on your business cards.

When you introduce yourself you can even use that tagline, as long as it's not cheesy or jargony or cliché.

As I mentioned in the last video, go for more than the food.

Savvy networkers will eat before they go to the networking event.

They're not there to spend time around the food and consume themselves with what the next thing is that they're going to eat.

They are there for the relationship.

I'm not saying that you have to forego the food, sometimes the food is amazing.

What I'm suggesting is don't make that the number one goal of going to the networking events.

This is really hard to do if you're an introvert, but I suggest you work on meeting new people.

Build your skills on going up to somebody and introducing yourself.

It might seem uncomfortable at first, but the more you do it the better you'll get at it.

Meeting new people can enrich your life, it can be a lot of fun, and they might be the right person to introduce you to others in their network that really need to have a relationship with.

In addition to meeting new people, you should renew and nurture old relationships.

I love going to networking events and seeing people that I might not have seen in the last few months or even the last few years.

It's a fun reconnection.

Our job security, I mean our career management or income security, really rests on the relationships that we develop over time.

Renew those relationships and nurture those relationships.

A lot of times when we first meet new people the relationship is what I would call superficial.

It's at the surface level.

What I want to do is go into a deeper nurtured relationship and that takes time and multiple touch points.

One of the things I love doing is finding people who need to know others in my network.

I love to make introductions.

Making introductions is an easy thing to do.

I see two people who should know one another, I introduce them, and then I step out of the picture.

It's not my responsibility that the relationship goes well or they talk about the right things.

One of the things I love about making introductions is it builds my capital with each of the people that I introduce.

In other words, as I make an introduction, they almost become indebted to me.

They appreciate the introduction, they appreciate that I was thinking about them and trust them with one of my contacts, and when it comes time for me to ask for an introduction they should be a lot more open to it.

Finally, volunteer.

A lot of these networking events have a lot of roles that need to be filled.

Whether its speaking, which can be planned or it can be last minute, or something behind the scenes or even taking tickets or registering people, volunteer to help.

As you volunteer you get to know the host of the networking event better, which is great because they usually know everybody, and you get your name and your face in front of a lot of other people.

I hope these networking tips have helped you.

I remember talking to a professional in Canada who said, I just don't understand what networking is and why I should do it.

I thought that was quite interesting because everybody seems to be talking about networking, but some of the tactics and ideas like I've shared here on this screen should be helpful for you to understand why you should do it and how to do it.
Advanced Networking Tips

Let's talk about something that I'll refer to as level II networking.

This goes beyond the tips that I just shared.

All of those tips are things that you should be doing or working towards.

Level II networking has new ideas.

First, create your own networking events.

Instead of looking for opportunities to network, why don't you create your own.

These can be small groups, for example a Thursday morning mastermind meeting, or they can be bigger groups.

Whether it's just within your company or you invite other organizations.

If you've never created your own networking event, I'll tell you there's a lot of work behind this, but the benefits are amazing.

You get to meet so many people and so many people learn who you are.

If you want to have a bigger presence and brand, creating a networking event that's successful is a great way to do that.

Recently I read a blog post from our good friend and Pluralsight author, John Sonmez.

The question he was answering in his blog post was, how can I improve as a developer? He said the single best way to improve as a developer is to help others.

If you can get involved in their projects, you can learn a lot about the problems that they are coming up against, as well as get more exposure to problems that you might not be facing at all in your organization.

In one development role that I had I focused a lot on HR IT.

As I started getting new projects and helping people in the finance department, I was exposed to a whole new level of issues and problems and people.

I love the idea of helping others.

Just make sure that you come across as someone who really wants to help and is easy to work with, not that you're trying to politic your way into somewhere or become a know it all.

Another advanced idea is what my business coach calls storm starter calls.

He's really big on drumming up your own business as a small business owner.

We can use this idea in our level II networking, not as a small business owner, but somebody who wants to expand our relationships.

Storm starter calls are simply calling one of our contacts on a regular basis.

He suggests that business owners make a storm starter call everyday.

And it's simply a, hey how's it going, it's been a long time since we've talked and I just want to catch up with you.

You don't have to do this everyday, maybe you do it once a week or once a month.

The idea is that we're proactively reaching out to people in our network.

In Never Eat Alone, Keith Ferrazzi talks about becoming a power connector.

I love the idea of becoming a power connector.

This goes back to what I was talking about in the last video on connecting and introducing people within my network, but it's at a bigger more purposeful level.

As a power connector I'm regularly looking for people in my network that should know one another.

As I make a lot of connections between people in my network, I get a lot of value and people are much more ready and willing to help me.

Keith Ferrazzi also had a really cool idea that I loved.

He wrote a blog post that said, if you want to be better than 95% of your competition all you have to do is followup.

We all know that we should followup.

There's plenty of information on how to followup.

We might not even be afraid to followup.

The thing is we're just not doing it.

The cool thing is our competition isn't either.

As you meet somebody or develop relationships make sure you stay in touch, whether it's a thank you card, thank you for their time, or a here's an article that you might be interested in.

The more you followup, the deeper your relationship goes.

You're nurturing your relationship and you're standing apart from the other 95% who are not following up.

One more idea on level II networking is to be consistent.

The postcard that I have in front of me from my business coach says, consistency trumps commitment.

Networking is not something we do when we need to do it, networking is something that just becomes a part of who we are.

If you only do it every once in a while people are going to wonder why all of sudden you're interested in them or you're nice to them.

If it's a part of who you are and you do it consistently they won't wonder that at all.

They'll know that you have good intentions and you're really interested in them.

Can you imagine the impact this could have on your relationships? What about the impact it will have on your personal brand? How will level II networking and the relationship nurturing and the branding help you toward your objectives and your goals during the first year in your organization? Can you see how this might set you up for a very powerful career?
Volunteering: Why, Where, When

Let's drill down into the idea of becoming a volunteer or volunteering effectively.

I remember in my job search I was told to volunteer.

It's a great way to meet new people and all the other great reasons why you should volunteer.

I found a nonprofit organization that I wanted to volunteer at.

I called them up and I said, hey this is who I am, I'd love to volunteer at your organization.

The lady on the other end had no idea why I would even want to volunteer there.

It was a very weird and uncomfortable conversation.

I didn't get a volunteer opportunity, I hung up the phone scratching my head thinking, that was really weird and I never tried again.

However, I'm sold on the idea of volunteering.

Let's talk about the why, where, and when.

First, volunteering expands your network.

Remember in a previous video I talked about my CFO.

His network was greatly expanded outside of his company and industry because of his volunteer work.

We can also expand our skills.

When we volunteer we let people know what our skills are and how we want to contribute, but a lot of times in a volunteer situation things just need to get done and you might be the only person that can help do it, even if it means learning on the job.

There is something good about helping others, right? It makes us feel good.

It makes us feel more a part of a community.

As we feel good and maybe get more purpose in our own lives, those feelings and the benefit can transfer to other parts of our life.

Whether that's our personal life or our work life.

Also, as you volunteer you help brand your company.

People will know who you are, what you do in your day job, and where you work.

If you do a good job that will reflect well on your organization.

Where can you volunteer? I'm sure there are opportunities internally within your company.

There are also opportunities externally outside of your company.

Don't shy away from opportunities just because it might take a few hours a week or a few hours a month.

You can also look for opportunities to volunteer with youth, with your church group, in your neighborhood, and other places.

If you're having a problem finding places to volunteer, ask other people where they volunteer or if they know of any opportunities.

Now the big question, when in the world will I have time to do this? Make sure that your volunteering is realistic.

If you don't have time in the next quarter because of projects you are working on or stuff that's happening at home, then don't do it or at least make it clear that you have a limited amount of time.

Also, consider the long term commitment.

Sometimes volunteer opportunities are very quick and maybe it's a one day thing.

Other times they are long term.

I recently talked with somebody who volunteered to help a local playhouse with some of their building maintenance needs.

That was five years ago.

Now he's the director of the playhouse and pretty much runs everything.

This works well with his schedule and with his family life because his family is involved in plays and theater, but I know he didn't think five years ago that he would be doing such a heavy role right now.

You might be able to swing it so you can do your volunteer work during work hours.

A lot of companies like to give their employees time to do volunteer work.

Consider if there are any after hour commitments, which could get in the way of family time or other commitments that you already have.

Don't let any of this scare you away.

Volunteering can be a rich experience for you, not just because it expands your network and it strengthens your brand with other people, but helping others and helping the community can really enrich your life.
Prepare Now for the Annual Performance Review

One of the things on your objective or goal list is to have a one year review or performance review with your boss.

Here are some things that you can do during the first year to prepare for that one year review.

First, ask your boss what to expect.

Ask for the format and the questions and the objects that he or she has for you.

This shouldn't be a secret, it's not like a pop quiz at school.

When you go into your performance review you shouldn't be blindsided by any expectations.

Also, ask coworkers what to expect.

Your boss might have great ideas of what he or she wants to ask you.

The coworkers might say, yeah it was a pretty casual conversation and we really didn't get to any objectives.

I wouldn't say that's unusual at all.

The coworkers are going to have a good idea of how stringent or relaxed the boss is going to be in that performance review.

Do research on Glassdoor.

Glassdoor.

com is a terrific resource to understand what's happening in your organization.

A lot of posts on Glassdoor will be anonymous reviews of the bosses or the performance review processes or the raises.

Glassdoor can provide you an interesting perspective on what to expect and what's happening within your organization.

Just be careful that you don't become too jaded or pessimistic about what others are saying from within your organization.

Remember its anonymous.

Some things in Glassdoor might not be truthful.

I strongly encourage you to document your accomplishments and things that happen over the year.

The list of accomplishments that you can bring into your meeting and even dollar amounts, if applicable, can be really beneficial as you talk about things with your boss.

This actually helps you develop an agenda in the review.

In other words, instead of having a very relaxed meeting, you can come in and say, in the last 12 months here are the things that I've worked on, here's how they went, this project saved the company $50, 0000, this project helped us work towards the $5, 000, 000 sale.

This is something that every employee should be doing as they prepare for their annual review, but don't do it the week of the annual review.

Do it during the last year.

That's where those weekly and monthly meetings come in.

One think you might consider is creating what's called a job journal.

I learned about job journals from a resume writer who said that she loves it when her clients come in with a list of past accomplishments.

It makes it so much easier for her to create a resume if she has things that she can refer back to.

As soon as I learned about the power of this, we designed a job journal that fit right into JibberJobber.

This helps you keep track of and document these accomplishments over the course of your career.

In addition to accomplishments, document your own growth.

What are the learning opportunities that you've had? What are the things that you've done that have been outside of your comfort zone? What networking events have you gone to and volunteer opportunities have you taken advantage of? You might not get a chance to talk about those things in your annual review, but having them ready to talk about could be very helpful.

For example, if your boss questions whether your actually doing things in the personal growth arena, you can whip out your list and say, well here are the things that I've done to become a better communicator, networker, problem solver, or whatever it is that they're questioning you on.

Finally, as you prepare over the year for your one year review, think about a plan for improvement.

Whether that's to continue with what you're already doing or its to work on new things for the next year.

Let your boss know that you're really interested in improvement.

There are a number of things that you should do in the week or two before your annual review, but doing these things during that first year will help ensure that you have a good annual review at the end of the year.
Personal Onboarding Wrap-up

It's time to wrap up this module and this course.

We've talked about personal onboarding, making sure that you get up to speed in your new job.

I want you to own the onboarding process.

Don't get in the way of the HR onboarding process, but own your own onboarding process.

This helps you become more valuable to your company and to your coworkers and within the industry.

It also helps you strengthen your personal offering and have personal growth.

Whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, you can become well known within your organization.

Everything we talked about helps strengthen and reinforce your personal brand.

You should create systems to help you do this stuff.

At the very least, use a calendaring and task management system and consider using something like a job journal to help you record your accomplishments.

Use Pluralsight to continue your personal growth.

Not just in the expertise that you have, but in adjacent expertise or other interests including career management.

Make sure you are networking and especially nurturing relationships.

I'm not talking about just getting more business cards that you can stuff into your top drawer.

I'm talking about real relationships.

Look for opportunities to volunteer and to help others.

And finally, own your career management.

Thanks for spending time on this course and I hope that this helps you ramp up and become a better employee at your new company.
