Finding a Mentor and Starting the Mentor Relationship
Introduction

Welcome to the course on how to get more out of mentoring as a mentee. This course is for the person who is at a point in their career where they realize that getting help from others can help them overcome situations that they just can't get passed on their own. This might be you. Perhaps you feel like you have a stalled career or maybe you're just bored and think you want a change in your career. You might feel like you're in a lonely personal place and it's impacting your goals or your happiness. You need someone, a mentor, to guide you through some decisions you need to make. Maybe you could use help from someone who has a better network than you do. In this first module, we'll talk about things you can do to get this process started, but first let's begin with a quote. This quote says, "In a world where seemingly every piece of information can be Googled, there's still some knowledge that can only be gained through experience. " We'll gain a lot of knowledge through our own experience. In this course we're going to talk about how you can gain knowledge through someone else's experience. Let's get started.
Mentoring vs. Coaching vs. Counseling

One of my first formal mentoring experiences, where I was the mentee, was an eye opener. My mentor, Ken, was someone I had networked with long enough to know that I wanted to learn from him. He had the experience and success I was looking for and was hoping to emulate. I learned a lot about my role as the mentee and what the role of a mentor was. I was hoping, even expecting, to have highly productive meetings where my mentor would give me answers to help me move my career forward quickly. I was surprised to have very different conversations than what I was expecting. Even though I had ideas of what I expected, I had not defined my expectations, nor I had I shared them with Ken. I didn't even really have a solid understanding of how this relationship could best work. I am convinced that we both could have gotten more value out of the relationship if we had a better understanding of our objectives. In this module, we will talk about things that would have helped me have a better mentoring relationship with Ken. Let's get started.
Formal vs. Informal Mentors

Digging a little deeper into what it means to be a mentor, let's differentiate between a formal mentor and an informal mentor. The formal mentor knows about the relationship. This is someone that you've approached and in one way or another have invited them to be your formal mentor. They've agreed to this relationship, and they know what their role is in the relationship. You've also had a conversation about the expectations of the relationship. They know what the expectations are and they agree with those expectations. In a formal mentoring program, you'll typically have regularly-scheduled sessions with the mentor. Whether that's every week, every other week or once a month, these are scheduled out for quite a while. Typically, a formal mentoring relationship is a long-term relationship. Let's contrast these with an informal mentor. An informal mentor might not even know that you consider them your mentor. Over the years I've heard someone talk about people who they consider a mentor. They never had a formal mentoring relationship, but they learned things as if that person were mentoring them. In an informal relationship like this, there aren't necessarily regular meetings. You can have meetings, you can go to lunch, you can have phone calls, whatever type of meeting you want to have, but they're not scheduled out over the next year. You might not ever talk with or meet your informal mentor. You might just read a column they write or listen to them on the radio. Because you don't have a formal relationship set up with them, if you have the opportunity to talk with an informal mentor and ask them for feedback on a certain situation, they don't have any obligation to give you honest feedback. There isn't necessarily a relationship of trust built, and they might not have enough information to really give you honest feedback. If you do have a meeting with an informal mentor, there is no obligation on their part to prepare or even think about the meeting before you sit down with them. Finally, you don't need to have a relationship with someone in order for them to be an informal mentor. In this course, we're going to focus on the one-on-one formal mentoring relationship, however, a lot of things that we talk about could apply to anyone that you consider an informal mentor also.
Finding the Right Mentor

This is a quote that's important for anyone who's looking for a mentor to internalize. It says, "A great match for one person may be a bad match for another. " Don't look at another person's mentoring relationship and think, oh, if only I had that person as a mentor or if my mentor was like that. Here are some considerations to think about as you look for a great mentor for you. First, start with YOUR needs. What is it exactly that you're looking for? Does it have to do with progress in your career? Does it have to do with progress in your own company or just in the industry in general? What are the things that you're hoping to get out of that relationship? Identifying your needs will help ensure that you find the right mentor to help you meet those needs. You should find a mentor who has done what you want to do. They have already gone down that path, they know what it looks like, and they can help you navigate that path because they've been down the path. Developing a chemistry between you and the mentor is critical. If you feel like there's something missing in the interpersonal relationship before they're your mentor, you might ask yourself whether you think that can change or not. If the chemistry will never be there, it might not be a good match. In addition to chemistry, personalities are really important. Some people are very abrupt with their feedback and they can come across as offensive. They're not necessarily trying to offend you, they're just trying to be very honest. I'm not suggesting that there's going to be a right or a wrong personality match for you, but if you do feel like there's tension in the relationship, you might want to study up on personalities to see what the difference is between their personality and your personality, and how to work together and communicate better. Of course, when you think you've found the right mentor, you need to make sure that they're actually in a place in their career where they can, and they're willing, to help you. Do they have the time or interest to volunteer as your mentor? These are five considerations to think about as you look for a mentor that will be right for you. Where can you find someone to be your mentor? Start off with who you know. Who is in your network that you think would be a great mentor for you? As you brainstorm names to be your mentor, what I don't want you to do is disqualify people, assuming that they wouldn't be your mentor. Write everybody down on a list without already deciding whether they want to do it or not. Once we have a list, we can prioritize the list and work down that list, but don't automatically cross people off. In addition to who you know, people in your first degree network, think about people that you could get an introduction to, or who are people that your first degree contacts might know. Obviously, you can use LinkedIn to dig deeper into your network, including your first degree contacts and beyond. Don't discount other social networks like Facebook or Twitter. Typically people don't go onto Facebook or Twitter because they want to be a mentor or even have a professional relationship with you, but if you have connections on Facebook or Twitter or other social networks, those might be people who can be a mentor or introduce you to someone who could be your mentor. Also, ask your colleagues and the people you work with. You might ask questions like, who do you admire in our company? Who do you think has had a great career? Who has helped you in your career? These are three questions that you can ask your colleagues to get some great ideas for who the right mentor might be for you.
How to Ask Someone to Be Your Mentor

Let's talk about how we can ask someone to be our mentor. We've identified the person, and now we need to approach them and ask for this formal relationship. Before we do that, though, I want to talk a little bit about this quote, "the mentor relationship needs to be an active one. " As you think about your mentoring relationship, don't think about a once-a-month lunch that you're going to have with someone. This is a real relationship where we're putting in effort, the mentor is putting in effort, we're going to learn and grow. That can be painful at times. It's definitely going to be an active relationship. Here are some things to think about with regard to asking someone to be our mentor. First, we should have a relationship with this person. Hopefully it's one of our first degree contacts, but it could even be from an introduction from one of our first degree contacts. You wouldn't walk up to somebody on the corner of a street and say, hey, would you be my mentor. That's asking a lot of someone who really has no idea who we are. As you think about a formal mentoring relationship, you might want to think about starting small. Instead of committing to a 12 or 24 month relationship, maybe you ask for one meeting. That way they can get an idea of what your needs are and whether they could help you or not, and you can get an idea of their style and the way they respond. Before you ask someone for a mentoring relationship, you should know what you want. We already talked about identifying your needs and objectives. The more you can define this, the better that conversation will go when your mentor says, well, what are you looking for and how do you think I can help you? I encourage you to actually practice inviting the person to be your mentor. This is a serious commitment that you're getting into and asking them to get into. Why not take some time in front of the mirror or with 3 x 5 cards to practice how that conversation is going to go? When you ask someone to be your mentor, you'll need to help them understand the scope of what you're asking them for. You're not asking them to come to your office every day or every week, maybe you're simply asking for that once-a-month check-in. Helping them understand their role and the scope of the relationship can help them know whether this is something they can commit to or not. Also, they need to know that you are ready and willing to work. This mentoring relationship isn't necessarily about them, although they should get plenty of value from the relationship, this is about you. You have objectives, you have a problem, you need help, are you really ready to do the work? Make sure they know that you are ready. You should be ready for them to say "no. " They might already be too committed or really not understand the value of a mentoring relationship for them. If you ask someone for a relationship and they turn you down, I wouldn't take it too hard or take it personally. Maybe their circumstances will change later or for now someone else might be a better fit. Essentially, you are trying to sell them on this relationship. Because of that, you might want to think about what the value will be for them. What are they going to get out of being a mentor? Think about that and have some responses prepared so that you can have a better conversation. Here are four parts of the conversation you might have when you ask them to be your mentor. Because the order can be mixed up, I didn't number them 1 through 4, instead I've used A, B, C, and D. One of the elements of your request is to present why you want to have the relationship. This might look like this, "I feel kind of stuck in my career right now... ", or "I want to get to the next level of my career... " or, "I know I need a guide to help me through this situation... " Basically what you're doing is you're setting out the reason why you need a mentor. Another element is to explain what their role would be. For example, "I'm looking for someone who can help me... " do a certain thing, "I think it's time to sit down with someone once a month... " What this would tell me is that you've already done a certain amount and feel like you've maxed out what you know how to do, and now you need to bring somebody in. Or, you put it all out on the table and say, "I'm looking for someone who can mentor me... " Another element of this conversation is where you explain your commitment or the idea that you're ready to work. You might say, "I know it will be a lot of work on my part, and I'm ready... " to do that work. Or you might say, "I'm committed to doing what it takes to get there... " Or you might say, "I plan on spending a lot of time to get... ", and then whatever the objectives are that you've already laid out. The final part of this conversation is when you actually ask them if they would be your mentor. You might say, will you meet with me as a mentor for the next three months or you could say, "are you open to being my mentor to help me... " work through these problems. Or you could say, "will you help me by being my mentor and guiding me... " as I work towards my next promotion. I've given you four different elements of this conversation. In summary, they are, present the reason why you're looking for a mentor, explain what their part would be, explain your commitment, let them know that you're ready to work, and finally, ask them if they will be your mentor. Now the question is, should we do this on the phone, should we do it in email, or should we do it face-to-face? I would prefer the meat of this conversation to happen fact-to-face. I think that's the best way to do this, however, that's not always going to be possible. You can do this on the phone or in email or face-to-face. Whichever way you choose to do this, just make sure that you have some kind of relationship and are ready to have the conversation that would include the four elements that we just talked about.
Defining the Objectives of the Relationship

I've mentioned defining your goals or objectives of the mentoring relationship. We'll talk about that in a second. Let's start off with a quote, "The most effective mentoring relationships take place when the mentors and mentees bring certain skills to the table. " In other words, you don't go to a meeting and wait for them to give you everything, you're brining your own skillset. Remember, they're not a paid professional coach, they're typically they're in a volunteer capacity. Not only are they not making money from this relationship, they're probably giving up other things, whether it's work time or personal time, to meet with you. Make sure that you're bringing skills to the table also. When we talk about defining the objectives of the relationship, we're talking about the why, the big WHY. Why do I want to spend time on this, why am I going to drive across town, why am I going to work hard all month in preparation to meet with my mentor, what is it that I really hope to get out of this relationship? Not only should you define the big why, you should define every single objective. I want to get better at this, I want to get better at that, I want my network to be richer, I want to be able to walk into a room and feel comfortable. Every single objective that you hope to get out of the relationship should be defined. As you define those objectives, think about which specific skills you want to improve. Are they technical skills, presentation skills, people skills, whatever it is, make sure those are written down. Your mentor needs to know what your objectives are. As you think about these objectives, you can group them, for example, do certain objectives have to do with career advancement or do they have to do with networking progress or entrepreneurial thinking? You could probably group every single objective into a few main categories. I've listed a few objectives that you could define, but really, you need to define what you want to get out of this relationship.
Establishing Ground Rules

In a mentoring relationship, you both are expected to bring things to the table. Because of this, it could be helpful to establish some ground rules. I'll share a few examples of ground rules from the mentee and the mentor in just a minute. First, a quote, "successful mentoring programs offer both structure and flexibility. " As you think about your ground rules and maybe how often you meet, where you meet, when you meet, things like that, realize that you're defining these things so that you can have some structure but also remember that you both have things going on so you need to have flexibility. In other words, these ground rules and other expectations are not necessarily set in stone. Here are some examples of ground rules that I might expect a mentee to have. I will let my mentor know when I cannot meet. If we're supposed to meet on Thursday at a coffee shop, and I can't come, I need to let my mentor know as soon as possible. That way they can free up that slot in their calendar and I'll know that they're not sitting in a coffee shop waiting for me to come. Another ground rule might be, I will not miss meetings because I feel unprepared. I think it's unprofessional to skip out on a meeting simply because you feel unprepared. If you feel unprepared, don't be a no-show. What you might do is communicate to your mentor and say, we were supposed to meet this afternoon, but I really haven't been able to get to the things that we talked about, and then give them the opportunity to postpone the meeting. They might decide that you should meet anyways. Of course, that really leads to the next one, which might be, I will be prepared for my meetings. If they're going to take their time and share ideas with you, you need to make sure that you're doing your part and prepare for the meetings. Because we're talking about your personal growth, there are probably going to be things that take you out of your comfort zone. A ground rule might be, I will follow-up on tasks, even if they're hard. Also, in a relationship like this, you have the opportunity to hear from someone who can honestly and candidly tell you what you're doing wrong or where you need to make some corrections, This isn't always easy to hear and accept. A ground rule for a mentee might be, I will gracefully accept direction and criticism, I will be honest with myself and my mentor, I will pay for my own expenses, which means I'm not going to get a mentoring relationship and expect a free lunch every month for the next year, and a final example, I will use a mentoring journal. We'll talk about that in module 2. It seems like you're committing to a lot of ground rules. Really you are, this relationship is about you and your progress. The mentor's ground rules are a little more forgiving. Here are some examples. My mentor will keep keep the topics and details of our meetings confidential, and maybe even private. I think it's easy to assume that you'll keep these conversations private and they'll keep the conversations private, but this really needs to be something that you discuss and agree upon before you start meeting. I expect that my mentor will share ideas that will help me with my objectives. I expect that my mentor will be honest with me so that I can overcome these issues, even if it's hard for them to be honest about a touchy topic. I expect my mentor to be "present" during our scheduled meetings. If I have a mentoring session with you, I don't want you to be on your cell phone for half of the session. If there's something that urgent that you need to take care of, maybe we should reschedule, but if you're going to give me an hour, please be present while we're together. I might expect my mentor to make networking introductions when they're appropriate, and I hope that my mentor will have fun in this process and feel appreciated for helping me. These are some examples of ground rules that you might establish with your mentor.
The Mentoring Contract

A best practice to implement when starting a mentoring relationship is to create a contract between both parties. We'll talk about what the contract might include in a minute. First, let's dive into this quote, "A mentoring relationship is not like a marriage or other permanent commitment, the goal is to help you move forward in your career and life goals. " Of course, by now you've already defined what your objectives are for this mentoring relationship, but I think this sums it up pretty good, to move forward with our goals, whether they're career goals or life goals. If this, moving forward in those goals, is not occurring, and you do not see adjustments that can be made in the relationship to meet your goals, end it, respectfully and honestly. You and your mentor should not feel stuck in the relationship. That's something that a contract can help avoid, because in the contract you actually talk about how to end the relationship. Here are some reasons why you would have a mentoring contract. A mentoring contract makes the relationship formal. There is no question about whether they're the mentor and you're the mentee. This is now a formal relationship, you've agreed upon certain terms, and even signed your name to it. You would both have access to a copy of the contract so you can see what you've committed to. If you wonder where you're at and where you're headed, you might go back to the contract to see whether you're on track or whether you've deviated from what you agreed to in the first place. When you have a mentoring contract, you now have something that lists out rules and expectations, and you know that you both have understood and agreed to the rules and expectations. Also, a mentoring contract might detail the boundaries of the relationship, for example, don't call me after 9:00 at night or before 6:00 in the morning. Some of the things on this slide might not seem like a big deal, but trust me, if you haven't established that you shouldn't call me at 3:00 in the morning, that one phone call could be a really big deal. There are a number of templates online for mentoring contracts. Here are some of the elements that you might have in your mentoring contract. You could have goals and objectives explicitly stated. You could even define what success of the goals or objectives would look like, for example, my goal is to get my next promotion, so success would be when I got an offer to have that promotion. So the definition of success might read, get a formal offer to my next title. In a mentoring contract, you might list out the expectations of each party. This might include some of the ground rules that were in the previous video. Every mentoring contract should have a clause in there about confidentiality. This doesn't have to be intricate legal jargon, but you should define what expectations each of you have of the confidentiality of your relationship and your conversations. A mentoring contract might lay out the appropriate contact information, how do I want you to contact me, and what the boundaries are of communicating with me. It might outline the meeting frequency, for example, we'll meet the first Tuesday of every month at 12:00. There's a whole host of other minutia that you could include that you'll find in mentoring contracts online. I'm not a fan of having a big document that's going to list everything out, because I don't want to keep track of all of these rules, but whatever is important to both of you could certainly go into the mentoring contract. One of the most important things to include is how the relationship will end. Do you end it when you've met all of the objectives or reevaluate the relationship and maybe go on for another year. How do you end it if things aren't going well? It's better to think and talk about how to end the relationship now, then when things might be tense in a few months.
Keeping the Relationship Professional

When you're working closely with a mentor, it's only natural that sometimes your relationship can get casual. Here are some ideas on how to keep your relationship professional. First, make sure that you always do what you say you will do. Your mentor needs to know that if you're going to have a conversation and you commit to something, that you'll actually follow through with that commitment. If you can't follow through with the commitment or you have a reason why it doesn't make sense anymore, then have that conversation, but if you commit to doing something, then do it. As I mentioned earlier, if you're going to miss a meeting, that can be okay, but give me a heads up. Let me know that you're not going to be there so I don't spend my time going to a meeting that's not going to happen. In our meetings, there will be a number of things that I ask you as the mentee to do. When you complete those things, I want to know. You don't have to wait for the next monthly meeting, you can send me a quick email and say, hey, you remember this thing we talked about, I just completed it and here's how it went. Throughout the month, as I get those types of communications, I'll feel confident that our relationship is going in the right direction and you really are in this to make progress. Let me encourage you to use professional language. Again, it's easy to get into a casual relationship mode, and use language that you might not use in the office. Even though the relationship seems like it's getting a little casual, this is still a professional relationship. I encourage you to maintain that professionalism with the language that you choose to use. Sometimes things can get stressful and emotional. It's okay to have emotions, but I would consider yelling a mistake. Definitely don't yell at your mentor, but even raising your voice and becoming too passionate about a topic could be off-putting. Because your mentor is a volunteer, you probably don't have a strong position to demand that they do certain things. Be respectful of what they're giving to you. If you really need a networking introduction, but they're not ready to make that introduction yet, there might be a reason for it. The last thing you should do is demand that they make the introduction. Also, because of how closely you'll be working with your mentor, there are going to be mistakes made. You might get stood up at a restaurant or they might have committed something to you by the end of the week and not delivered on it. If you want to have a long-term relationship, I encourage you to be "quick to forgive. " Finally, remember that there are boundaries associated with them volunteering. At any point they can say, I've had enough, this just isn't working out, this person isn't putting forth the effort, they're not doing the things that I suggest, they don't even listen to what I'm talking about, and they're hard to work with. All of those things would be pushing the boundaries of your volunteer, and you can find yourself without a mentor very quickly.
Keeping the Relationship Appropriate

In addition to keeping the relationship professional, let me encourage you to keep the relationship appropriate. Here are some ideas. First, do not flirt, ever. You might feel like there are certain vibes in the relationship. Let me encourage you to not flirt. Once you go there, you can't take it back, and it automatically changes the dynamics of your relationship. Let's talk about those vibes. You might feel like there are certain vibes, but let me encourage you to not assume any inappropriateness. In other words, don't assume that there are those vibes, just stay away from that topic altogether. Some of us like to tell jokes. I've never seen a professional environment where telling a joke that's inappropriate, for example, a dirty joke, is a good thing. Any time I've heard an inappropriate or a dirty joke, it has always changed the dynamics of that conversation, and the trust level of other people in the room. Similarly, I would encourage you to watch your language. I'm not talking about professional language, which we talked about in the last video, I'm talking about bad words. Even if you're inclined to use bad words, or your mentor uses bad words, I would encourage you to keep your language clean. Don't you feel like I shouldn't even have to say these four things? Well, here are four more things. First, gossip has a place, but it's definitely not in your relationship. What happens when you share gossip about someone, no matter how juicy it seems, the person that's listening to you eventually wonders, I wonder what they're saying about me, or what would they ever say about me to someone else. Be very careful how you talk about other people. How you talk about people impacts how much other people are going to trust you. Similar to gossip, let's talk about talking bad about anyone. Let's say that it's obviously the truth, we're not in the realm of gossiping anymore, we're just sharing what the truth is, however, the results would be the same as if you had gossiped. Talking bad about anyone will always have negative repercussions. If your mentor feels like they need to talk about someone, don't jump on that bandwagon. You can politely listen to them, but you don't have to indulge in talking bad about someone, even if they started it. Another way to keep your relationship appropriate is to understand those boundaries of communication, for example, don't text me at 4:00 in the morning. You might not be able to sleep and have had a great idea, but if I use my phone as an alarm clock, I'm going to get woken up at 4:00 in the morning. This is the one we started with, and I want to end with it because it's so important. If you start flirting, you might as well discontinue the mentoring relationship, because you have possibly changed the dynamics of the relationship to the point of no repair.
Mentee Key Success Factors

We've talked about a number of things to help you set up and have a great mentoring relationship. Let me share some ideas, which I'll call key success factors, for you, the mentee. In order for you to be successful as a great mentee, I suggest that you be an active listener. If you don't know what that means, check out the course on Pluralsight called, Becoming a Better Listener. As a mentee, you're going to have to dig deep inside yourself and share things that might be really hard to share. If you really want to make progress, you need to be brutally honest with yourself and your mentor. It's time to stop making excuses and explore what the root issues are so that you can make the progress that you need to make. If you don't have a deep desire to improve and actually make that progress, you probably shouldn't have a mentoring relationship, instead, just have lunch once a month, and touch on superficial things, but if you're really going to make progress, you have to desire to improve. Of course, you have to be ready to put the work in. This means you might have to turn the TV off at night or forego some of your hobbies. If they're going to give you their time so you can meet your goals, it's time for you to get busy and do the work that it takes. A successful mentee will also be respectful of a mentor, their time, and your time. Let's sum those up with five words, listener, honest, desire, work, and respectful.
What Did I Miss?

What are other things that you would add to this module? Do you have any questions about getting started with a mentor? The best place to ask those questions is in the Discussion section for this course. On this page, click on the Discussion link, where we can further this conversation.
Wrap-up

In this module, we talked about getting started with a mentor. We talked about what mentoring is, contrasting it to coaching and counseling. We talked about considerations on finding the right mentor for you and how to ask them to be your mentor. We talked about your objectives, keeping the relationship professional and appropriate, and we also talked about the key success factors for the mentee. In the next module, we're going to talk about how you can optimize your meetings and your communication with the mentor.
Optimize Meetings and Communication with Your Mentor
Introduction

Now that you have your mentor and you've both agreed to this mentoring relationship, let's talk about things that we can do in the meetings and between meetings to have a great relationship and really move forward.
Accommodating Your Mentor

A mentoring relationship is pretty interesting, because usually the mentor doesn't get any financial compensation from the relationship, and also they're a volunteer, they might have never done this before. Because of those things, and because you requested the relationship for your personal growth, here are a few things you can do to accommodate your mentor. One of the first things you should do is ask yourself, what can you do make their role easier and enjoyable? Of course, they could grow and learn from this relationship, but this is a relationship that's designed to help you the most. This doesn't mean that they're not going to put work into it, but you shouldn't expect them to put a lot of work, especially where they would be sacrificing other opportunities. What are the things that you can do to help them? Make sure you clarify your expectations with money. For example, if you agree to meet monthly for lunch, is the mentor going to be in a situation every month where they're going to wonder if they're going to be paying for your lunch? Make that clear up front. A best case scenario is that you pay for their lunch every time, or that you each pay for your own expenses. Be considerate of their schedule. Some mentors will have a more flexible schedule than others, but all of them will value their time. Sometimes I'm asked to do a presentation or have a lunch meeting with someone, and they don't realize that the amount of time that it takes for me to get ready, the travel time, and then the time in the meeting could take me out of the office for 4-6 hours. You don't want to do that to your mentor. Also, if you're meeting face-to-face, consider their travel needs. If it's possible, I would suggest that you meet close to where they already are so they don't have to take extra time out of their schedule, and they don't have to worry about travel, including time and parking. A specific way to accommodate or help your mentor is to prepare agenda items and send those things to the mentor before the meeting. That way they'll have something to think about and work from instead of just trying to remember what you talked about in the last meeting. As you get more comfortable with one another, your mentor is going to need to give you candid feedback. This could be really hard for them to do. You need to make sure that they know that it's okay for them to give you feedback. Another way to help your mentor be a great mentor is to come with questions that you've already thought about. In other words, don't sit down and say, okay, what should we talk about today? That's not the right way to approach these meetings. If you were to come to a meeting with a few questions or challenges, that givers a mentor a lot more to work with than just an open, what should we talk about today. Finally, recognize that your mentor might have a hard time sharing the message they want to share. It's okay to ask clarifying questions so you can really understand the message that they want to get across. These are a few ways that you can accommodate your mentor. What are some other ways that you can help them be a better mentor?
Meeting Etiquette

Most of the time, you'll meet with your mentor face-to-face, however, even if you just have webinar, virtual, or phone meetings, a lot of the ideas in this video will help you. Let's get started. First, show up early. When you show up early, you show that you're serious and you respect their time. Next, don't check your phone. When you're meeting with someone and they're checking their phone, it's so distracting. You don't know if they've checked out of the meeting already or if they're doing something that's relevant to the conversation. If you have an emergency that you simply can't put off, then you can let your mentor know, by the way, I might get a call from so-and-so during our meeting that I'll have to take. It'll be a quick call, but I can't let this go. I would try to keep those requests to a minimum. In general, you should put off all calls and texts until after the meeting. Related to that is being present. There are so many things that could distract us in a meeting, but if someone is going to give us an hour of their time, let's make sure that we're there and we're working on ourselves. When you dress appropriately, you show your mentor that you're serious about this meeting and you really want to have results. For some of us, this means that we have to dress up. If you work in a very casual environment and it doesn't matter what you dress like, you might find that you need to step it up a little bit when you meet with your mentor. This isn't necessarily a standard that they're imposing, it just shows how serious you are about making progress. If you have a time limit on your meeting, for example, 30 minutes or 60 minutes, make sure that you don't go off task and talk about all kinds of other things. You might find that by the end of your meeting you've talked about a lot of personal things and never got to the purpose of what that meeting was about. When you're meeting with your mentor, be respectful and let them finish their thoughts and ideas. It's sometimes okay to have a dialog where you're excited and you both start talking at the same time, but in general, try to not talk over your mentor. If you do that too often, they might feel like you're not listening to them, and wonder why they're even in this relationship. I was once at a lunch meeting with someone who I wanted to do business with. It was a fun conversation, but when the server came to the table, the other person was extremely rude to the server. I guess he didn't realize I would be paying attention to how he treated other people. After seeing that, I decided I didn't want to do business with him. When you're meeting with your mentor, you tend to be very respectful towards your mentor, but make sure that you don't show them another side of you where you're disrespecting other people. If you're meeting involves food, remember that food is not the reason why you're in a mentoring relationship. I remember a meeting I was in where we had 60 minutes together. 20 minutes, or one-third of our time, was taken up by ordering food and talking about the menu. We wasted one-third of our meeting on food. One thing that's distracting when you're talking with someone is when they are not looking at you. Whether they're looking at the TV over your shoulder, watching other people, or staring off in the distance, it seems like they're not involved in the conversation. Make sure that your body language says, I'm here and I'm interested, and one way to do that is to have appropriate eye contact. Finally, stay at the meeting until the meeting is done. If you've committed to an hour, then stay for the hour. If you need to leave early, let your mentor know that you need to change the schedule, but if they sacrificed their time, you should stay until the very end.
The First Meeting

The first official meeting with your mentor is the meeting where you can set your tone for the rest of the meetings. Here are some considerations. First, it's okay to do small talk. Some of us might be inclined to get right down to business and talk about the things we need to accomplish, but it's important to establish a relationship to the point where we can trust one another. Our mentoring sessions can get pretty deep, and we're going to need that trust in the future. Small talk is a way that we can get to know one another. In this first meeting, you should share your backgrounds and your experience. Of course, I'll read about you on LinkedIn or wherever I can read about you, and you might do the same for me, but hearing it while I'm right in front of you is different. You could spend time talking about boundaries, expectations, rules, norms, a lot of the things that we talked about in module 1. I wouldn't spend too much time on that, you should have already done that when you put together the contract, but if there is anything specific that you need to clarify or talk about, now would be a good time. After you've gotten to know each other better, what I'd like to see you focus on are the goals and objectives, not just of this meeting, but of your entire relationship. This is where you review what your objectives are and what you hope to get out of this relationship. As you talk about it, it might be a time to refine what your objectives are, but it'll definitely be an opportunity where you could both be on the same page.
Active Listening

Active listening is an important part of your mentoring relationship. Here are some ideas and tactics on how to be a better active listener. First, did you know that there's a course called Becoming a Better Listener? This is one of my courses. I go into detail about strategies and tactics that you can implement and practice to become a better listener. I encourage you to watch that course, because it'll help you in many aspects with your career. Let's assume that you only have a certain amount of time with your mentor, maybe 30 minutes, maybe 60 minutes. The bottom line is, after the time is up, you don't have any more time until the next meeting. Being an active listener helps you optimize the time that you have when you're with your mentor. As you practice active listening, you'll show that you really want to grow. You're not just there for a nice conversation or a nice lunch, you really want to make progress. Active listening shows that you really want to understand yourself and what the issues are and how to get to the next level, and active listening should help you capture ideas and retain information better. The opposite of active listening is passive listening, which is more like hearing without understanding or caring about the conversation. As I mentioned earlier, you should watch the Becoming a Better Listener course to get better with your active listening. Here are a few ideas that I got from that course. First, maintain appropriate eye contact. When I say appropriate I don't mean creepy where you're staring into their eyes the whole time, you won't be looking at them the entire time, but having appropriate eye contact will show that you're interested and engaged. Active listeners also take notes. We'll talk about better note-taking in this module. When you're an active listener, you should be able to conceptualize a summary of the main points of the conversation. What are the main things that you've gotten out of this mentoring session? Also, you should be able to summarize any action items that you're going to follow-up on. One of the tactics most commented on in my Becoming a Better Listener course is that of listening to someone with the idea that you'll teach someone else later. If you know that you're going to have a conversation later with someone where you'll summarize what you talked about during this session, surely you'll listen differently.
Receiving Feedback and Advice

Remember I said that at some point in your meetings the trust factor will be really important. Well, when you have to receive feedback from your mentor, trust will be a huge issue. If you don't trust them and don't know where they're coming from, it might be really hard to accept the feedback. Feedback might also be known as advice, suggestions, or even critiques. I chose the thumbtack image on the left because thumbtacks can be painful. Sometimes critique and feedback can be painful also. The reality is, the mentoring session should be a safe place where you can give and accept feedback, even if it's hard to hear. if you understand that the purpose of the feedback is to help you get to the next level, instead of dragging you down and beating you up, then it might be easier to accept hard feedback. When you're hearing feedback or advice about yourself, it's important to separate the what, the behavior, or where do I go from here, from the who. In other words, don't take it as a personal attack, take it as advice on how you can correct something to improve yourself or your position. It's probably hard for the mentor to give feedback, especially if it's uncomfortable feedback. Because of this, you might find that they're not stating things very clearly. Make sure that you understand what the real message is that they're trying to share with you, even if that means that you have to restate what they're saying or put it into your words. A natural tendency when we hear someone critiquing us might be to argue or rationalize why we did that thing. I would suggest that you consider this feedback a gift. Someone was brave enough to tell you something that other people might not have been able to tell you, and now you have the opportunity to make some corrections. Instead of arguing, rationalizing or justifying, let's figure out how we can focus on the what, or what we can do to improve, and not focus on making sure they know why we did that thing.
Better Note-taking

If I'm your mentor and we're talking about serious issues, I want to make sure that you're really capturing the ideas. You can do this by taking notes during our session. Here are some ideas to help you become a better note-taker. Have you heard of the studies that say that writing with a pen or a pencil is more effective for your retention than typing something on a computer? The message is, if you want to retain the concepts that you're taking notes on, do it on paper with a pen or pencil. However, you don't have to write every single word. What you should focus on are the main points. Now this could look like it's on a spectrum. On the one side you have wirte every single word, on the other side you have write only the main topics. The problem with writing every single word is that you might miss what we're talking about right now if you're still writing what we were talking about a minute ago. The problem with writing only the high-level topics is, there's no meat. You might not write a lot of the important details if you just wrote the high-level topic. You should find a happy place in between where you're writing what the topics are, but also jotting down important things within those topics. When you take notes, try to not cram everything in one or two pages, leave plenty of white space. You could leave space in the margin, you can double-space, you can skip lines, you can even write just on one side of the paper and leave the other side blank. This allows for flexibility in your notes after you're done taking notes. In your notes, don't be afraid to do non-word things, for example, symbols, arrows, smiley faces, underlines, anything that can break up your normal notes and bring certain concepts out, could help you remember or understand what you were talking about when you review your notes later. Just like you see on the image on the right, you can put checkboxes in your notes. I implement this tactic all the time. When I take notes about something, I collect information, but I also come up with follow-up or to-do items. When I go through my notes, I can easily pull out the to-do items because they all have a little checkbox next to them. When I finish the item I can simply check the checkbox. Realize that the notes you take don't have to be linear. I already talked about using smileys and arrows and things like that. One of the things that I'll do is fold the piece of paper into quarters. That way I now have four different sections on one piece of paper. That's just me, though. One of the messages that I want you to walk away with is, whatever works for you is what you need to do. There are a lot of different ideas on styles for note-taking, but the most important thing is, do what works for you so you'll get value out of your note-taking. I encourage you to keep your notes in one place. In the next video I'll introduce the idea of having a journal for your mentoring sessions. Within 24 hours of your meeting, go back and review your notes. You might want to make changes to your notes where you wrote something in shorthand and it makes sense to drill down on it, or you can write reactions to the things that you talked about. That's one of the reasons you want to have so much white space. When you revisit your notes later, you'll have space to put other thoughts and ideas in your notes. We talked about the idea of writing your notes with a pen or a pencil. After I do that, I'll put my notes into an email that I'll send to my mentor. This way we both have an email history or a record of what the main points are that we talked about. As a bonus, I'll also send that email to my CRM, which is JibberJobber, and now I have a record of my notes in my CRM.
Your Mentee Journal

By now you're sold on the idea of taking notes during your session and even revisiting those notes. Let me sell you on the idea of having a journal specifically in your role as a mentee. What would you have in your journal? Well, you would have the notes from the session that we just talked about. In your mentee journal you would also include thoughts and feelings, that is, how did you feel about certain advice or certain tasks that your mentor gave you that you might be uncomfortable with. It's okay to work through these feelings, especially in a journal. In your mentee journal, you would have those follow-up tasks, maybe with the little checkboxes that we talked about. As you complete the tasks, you could write what the results were. How did it go? What's the next step? Was finishing that task worth it, or was it as scary as you thought it would be? The mentee journal is a great place to document your thoughts after your meeting. This could happen directly after the meeting, or it could happen a few months later. Go back through your notes and look at the things that you wrote down, and now write what your reaction is to those things. Another thing you could include in your mentee journal is any inspiration that you got. When I look through my notes, I might have an idea to contact someone or reach out to a certain company. This is something that was never brought up in our meeting, but I was inspired to think about it when I was going through those notes.
Simulation and Role-play

One time when I was in a mentoring situation during a job search, my mentor suggested that we do a video-recorded mock interview. This is something that I was not looking forward to at all. I thought it was ridiculous. At the time I didn't understand or like doing simulations, role-plays, or mock anythings. However, I went through the process, and it turned out to be incredible. Let me share some ideas on how you can get value out of simulations and role-play with your mentor. First of all, understand that this scenario can be very quick. It can simply be one question from them and one answer, or response, from you. In my situation it was many questions and answers, but in order to do an effective simulation you don't have to take a lot of time on it. An example of that might be, how would you approach your boss about a tough issue that you want to talk to them about. You can have your mentor simulate the role of the boss and then you would be yourself going into that meeting. Maybe the only thing you're simulating is the very first part of that uncomfortable meeting. Realize that in a mentoring relationship you're in a safe environment. They are there to help you, and you are there to progress. This isn't something where they're going to tease you or bully you or tell everybody about your weaknesses. When you're in a simulation, pay attention to phrases that you use, as well as your body language. Because my interview was video-recorded, those were the things that were really easy to pick out once we were watching the video. A tactic that might help you understand your situation better is to reverse roles. Maybe you play the boss and your mentor plays you, to show you how they would do it in that situation. As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of power in recording video and then watching that video. The biggest thing I learned from watching myself interview was that I wasn't nearly as good at interviewing as I thought I was. Here's a tip to keep in mind during most of your simulations. Think about the What's In It For Me factor. That is, when you're role-playing, make sure that you're not just thinking about what you want to get across to the other person, but what's in it for them? What's the value or benefit for that other person?
Session Follow-up

After every mentoring session, you should follow-up with your mentor. We talked about this a little bit in the note-taking video. Here are some considerations with session follow-up. First, I would expect you to follow-up within 24 hours. If you do it right after the meeting, that's great. If you don't do it until the next day that's still okay, but make sure you follow-up pretty quickly. I would suggest that the follow-up is in an email that summarizes what you talked about. As I mentioned in the other video, you would include the talking points from your session and what you got out of it, as well as any follow-up items that you have or your mentor has. You might even include aha! realizations, for example, we talked about this specific topic, and here's what I realize was really holding me back. As a mentor I love hearing about these personal breakthroughs. You're probably having them regularly. Make sure you let your mentor know that you're having them so that they can know the sessions are actually valuable to you. In every session follow-up, make sure you express your gratitude towards your mentor. Finally, you might include details about the next meeting. Even if you already have these prescheduled, you can say, I'll see you next month on this day, at this place. Let me caution you to not let this email be too big. If it's too big, I'm probably not going to read the whole thing.
Task Follow-up

In addition to getting a follow-up after each session, I would really like to know how your tasks are going. Of course, you can wait until our next meeting, but that might be two weeks away. Here are some ideas on follow-up after tasks. First, I would follow-up on every single task that was assigned to you. Let the mentor know that you completed the task. I would do this soon after you finished each task, in other words, don't send an email on Friday saying, here are the four things that I did this week, just send me a short note or even a text saying, I did this particular thing. If the task didn't go as well as you hoped it would, you should still send a follow-up. I want to know that you put in the effort and you did your part. If we need to talk about that later, we'll do that in our next session, but I still want to know that you did that particular task. In general, these messages should be short. I simply want to know that you're making progress and working on the things that you said you were going to work on. If you want to make the follow-up a little longer, you can share with me what the results of completing the task were. These follow-ups are another great opportunity to say thank you to your mentor. They are also a great opportunity to express your excitement for actually making progress. Having frequent follow-up can help me as a mentor know what's going on between our sessions.
The Power of Accountability

At one point in my career, I was in a serious and difficult job search. I didn't have anyone that I was accountable to. Because of that experience and the result of not having an accountability partner, I am passionate about the idea of accountability. Here are some thoughts for you as a mentee. First, understand that if you are going to be accountable to your mentor, then you'll have a feeling that you are not alone. It's really easy to feel like we're alone as we progress through our career or whatever challenges that we have, but we're not alone, and when we're accountable to someone we feel like we're not alone. Just knowing that someone is there, interested in our progress and making sure that we're doing the things that we committed to, motivates us to do the right things. All of a sudden, the deadlines that we have and the tasks that we have are much more clear. We're going to work seriously on those, because we're going to have to report on them. The alternative is that the deadlines could be soft and we can push them off for days or weeks or months. Something important to think about with an accountability partner is that when they ask you whether you've done something or not, you're not in trouble even if you didn't do it, they're just asking whether you met the commitment or not. Make sure you have the right attitude when it comes to being held accountable. Accountability is the procrastination blaster. I was such a procrastinator during that hard job search. There were too many things that were hard to do, and nobody really knew or cared about the individual tasks and deadlines that I had. I was able to play Sudoku and read as many news articles as I wanted to. One of the principle benefits of being accountable to someone is that that person can make sure that we're focused on the right things. Instead of doing the easy things or doing things that aren't necessarily going to get us closer to our goal, an accountability partner, or our mentor, should help ensure that we're working on the right things to make progress towards our objectives. Here's a sequence of questions that your mentor might ask you in their capacity as your accountability partner. First, "did you do that thing that you said you were going to do? " They might ask you how it went, why you did it a certain way, or why you didn't do it at all. A good accountability partner will ask for more details. Tell me about it, explain what you did and what the reactions were. The cool thing about having a mentor is that they're already your accountability partner. Realize that that's one of the roles that they'll play, and it's one of the most powerful things that you could get out of this relationship.
Expressing Gratitude

Your mentor might not understand how grateful you are for the help that they're giving to you. Let me suggest that you express gratitude appropriately and frequently. Here are some ideas. Your expression of gratitude could actually be a gift. It doesn't have to be a gift, but it can be an appropriate gift. You can also write a thank you letter. Consider the difference between a thank you letter that has one or two sentences of gratitude versus a couple of paragraphs explaining how impactful you've been in their life. Another way to express your gratitude is to write a LinkedIn recommendation for your mentor. We've already talked about expressing gratitude during the session and the task follow-ups. One of the things that I want to know is that I actually had a real impact on your life. This can happen during our relationship, directly after our relationship, or even years after our relationship. I'm going to spend time with you to help you. It would be awesome if you could tell me later how beneficial our time was together. This is an easy way for you to give back to your mentor.
Helping Your Mentor

I've mentioned a few times that your mentor might be completely new at this. They're in a volunteer position, they're not getting financial compensation, and they might not have had any training on how to be a mentor. Recognize this, and give them a little bit of leeway as your mentor. Here are some ideas on how you can help your mentor be a better mentor. First, you can simply go online and print out some tips specifically for mentors. There are easily hundreds of articles and lists that you can draw from. In addition, you can point your mentor towards Pluralsight. There are a number of courses in the Career section that talk about mentoring, listening skills, as well as how to be a better communicator.
What Did I Miss?

What questions do you have at this point in the course? Do you feel like your communication and your meetings are going to be more effective because of the tactics we talked about? What are some ideas that you would add to this module? Go into the Discussion section of the page for this course and leave your thoughts or questions.
Wrap-up

In this mdoule we focused on optimizing meetings and communications with your mentor. We talked about a lot of ideas, including meeting etiquette, how to run your first meeting, being a better listener, accepting and receiving feedback, taking better notes, the art of the follow-up, as well as having an accountability partner. In the next module, we'll talk about ending the formal mentoring relationship and where to go from there.
Wrapping up Your Mentoring Relationship and Moving Forward
Introduction

Of course, there comes a point in every mentoring relationship where things change. Let's assume you've had a good long run, you've grown a lot, you've learned a lot, but now it's time to wrap up the relationship and move to something else. Hopefully it's been a great relationship and you're ending in a way that you had planned to end. Let's talk about how to wrap the relationship up, and how to move forward. I'll also share ideas about what to do if the relationship ends on a bad note.
The Last Meeting with Your Mentor

In the last module, we talked about the special first meeting that you would have, what are the things that you should do in that first meeting. Well, now it's time to talk about what you do in the very last meeting that you have with your mentor. Here are some things that you might talk about in this last meeting. First, what are the things that you've learned? This is a great time to debrief with your mentor and talk about the things that you've learned. Not just what you've recently learned, but how far you've come from the beginning of your relationship. Along those lines, you should be able to talk about how you've progressed or how you've changed. Maybe the two of you can talk about goals and objectives that you talked about at the beginning of your relationship, and now you can revisit those and talk about where you're at and how far you've come. Another great topic to talk about are what are the specific things that you've accomplished. Of course, we'll have our own ideas of what we've accomplished, but it's a great benefit to see our accomplishments and our progress through the lenses of our mentor as they've watched us grow and know what challenges we've had to overcome to get to where we're at. Spend some time and reflect on these things. Something else to talk about is, where do you want to go from here. Even though the mentor isn't going to be involved in the same capacity as they have been, they might have some great insight on what you could or should do for the future. They can help you identify future goals, or if you know what some of your future goals are, they might give you some advice or tips on how to move towards those goals. A helpful part of the conversation might include, what are the things that you need so that you can achieve those goals? Do you need time, money, training, or other resources to achieve those goals? This doesn't necessarily have to be a mentoring or a coaching session, but it could be a great opportunity to get some guidance from your mentor one last time. Your mentor might ask you how they did. Do you have any advice on how they could be a better mentor? I suggest that you share ideas with them tactfully, but only if they invite you to have that conversation. This last meeting should be a joyous event. You should both be happy with the progress that you've made, and excited about where you're headed.
Celebrate the End of This Relationship

Speaking of being excited, you should be excited to be at the end of this relationship. If it was a great mentoring relationship, this might be a bittersweet time, and that's okay. I encourage you to celebrate the ending of this relationship, which was the formal mentoring relationship. It's not necessarily the end of the relationship with the person, but it definitely is the end of this chapter in your relationship. Here are some considerations on celebrating the end of the formal mentoring relationship. It wouldn't be inappropriate to find some kind of meaningful gift. I say meaningful gift because I'm not looking for something like a trophy or a plaque or something that I might stick on my bookshelf and never look at. A meaningful gift would be something that might have some sentiment attached to it. If you've worked together for the last year or two, you've probably learned something about your mentor and what their personal preferences are. What are their favorite movies or books or quotes? A meaningful gift doesn't have to be expensive, you're simply giving them a token to help them remember the relationship and you. As I mentioned in the last module, this is a great time to give them a professional endorsement. This could be done in an email where you formally talk about things that they've done and they've enriched your life or your career. It could be in a LinkedIn recommendation or something along those lines. The more specific this is, and geared towards how impactful they've been on your career or your life, the more meaningful this might be. If it's possible, I encourage you to have a face-to-face celebration. This might be over lunch or dinner or something that formal. It could be something that's done over the phone, but think about whether it would also be appropriate to do something face-to-face. What are the things that you would talk about? You would recognize accomplishments. You spent a lot of time already recognizing your accomplishments and your growths, I think it would be interesting to recognize the mentor's accomplishments during the time that you've had this mentoring relationship. Also, a fitting tribute to the mentor could be recognizing their role. In addition to just talking about your growth, maybe you can talk about the growth that you've observed in them since you've started this relationship.
Your Final Mentee Email

Another component that brings the relationship to the end is an email from you to your mentor. This is the final email after your sessions. What would this email include? It could include a summary of all the things that you've learned, not just from the last session, but since the beginning. Having this documented in an email might be valuable for you and the mentor to revisit. You could also include a summary of your accomplishments. You could include what you're going to be doing as you move forward. What are the goals or objectives that you have? You've already developed a relationship with your mentor, why not let them know what you're going to do and see if there's any way they can help you, maybe with introductions or other information. In your final email, you might talk about the relationship moving forward. Let them know that you're willing to hear from them and want to continue a relationship. Of course, by now you should be really good at expressing gratitude regularly. There's no exception in this email. It would obviously be fitting to express gratitude for the entirety of the relationship. Another thing you can include in this email is your willingness to help them. Ask them what you can do for them. You want them to know that this is an ongoing relationship and you want to continue to provide value to them.
From Mentee to Professional Colleague

Your mentoring relationship has changed to something interesting. Instead of being the person who had a list of needs or objectives and you needed help from your mentor, you are now professional colleagues. This puts you on more equal footing. As you move forward in this new relationship, you might find that you are in a position to give and help them more than ever before. Basically, the dynamics have completely changed. No longer are they the giver and you're the taker, you can both be givers. In the email that we just talked about, I suggested that you offer your help. Now it's time to think of ways that you can help your colleague. This is a brainstorming session that you can have at this point in your relationship, but as months and years go by, continually look for opportunities where you can bring value to your colleague. It's important to realize that you really do have value that you can bring to the equation. If you've been in the relationship for a long time and you are used to presenting problems and issues, hoping to get help from them, you might have a hard time realizing that you actually do bring certain things to the table. One of the things that you might consider is switching roles as a mentor where you're actually their mentor. You can be mentoring them in an area that you are intimately familiar with and they really don't have that much experience with. We have a tendency to respect people who have helped us along the way in our career or our life and that's great, there's nothing wrong with that, but I just wanted to remind you that you should be able to bring value to them. You don't always have to be in a relationship where there's one giver and one taker.
Maintaining a Strong Relationship with Your Colleague

I really want you to think about how you can maintain a strong professional relationship with the person who was your mentor. Something I hear quite often is that people don't network unless they need to. Then they seem to be an extrovert and want to be friends with everybody, but if they don't need to, they tend to not network. Our relationships are too important in our career success nowadays. The person who you've just spent a lot of time with is a great person to be on your networking list. As I mentioned in the last video, the dynamics of the relationship have changed. The content of your conversation will also seem different. That's okay. That's just a natural evolution of where your relationship is going. You should always be thinking about what you can give or offer. Keith Ferrazzi is an author of networking books, and he talks about this idea he calls relationship capital. That is, think of your relationship as if it were a bank account, and every time you put something in, that is, every time you give something to the relationship, you're building up something of value. You're not necessarily going to draw down on that value every day or maybe hardly ever, but when you do want to draw down on your capital, you want to make sure that you've given a lot into that account. This is not something that you do just once or right after the relationship changed, this is something that you should do for the rest of your career, friendship, and maybe even life. If you don't find that you have a close enough relationship or you're going out to lunch once a month or once a year or something like that, maybe all you're doing is sending your colleague some value-add information, for example, you're mailing them a newspaper or magazine article or you're forwarding them a link to something that you know would be interesting to them. This is what I call a "touch point. " Any time that we have the opportunity to get in front of our networking contact or have a conversation or dialog with them, or provide them any value, we're having a "touch point. " Since you know this person so well, and what their interests and needs are, you should be able to have very thoughtful touch points with your colleague.
Making Introductions to Others

Making introductions between the person who used to be your mentor and other people in your network, might be one of the most valuable things that you can offer to everybody involved. When I was in my job search, I was in a position where I was asking things of other people, and other people were giving me things, and I didn't think that I had anything of value that I could return to them. I couldn't even take them to lunch because I didn't have enough money to pay for our lunches. However, I came to realize that as a job seeker I was doing a lot of networking. I was meeting people, and the people that I was talking with would love to have introductions to other people that I was meeting with. This is likely the same situation with people in your network, including the person who used to be your mentor. When you make these introductions, you're showing that you trust everybody enough that you'll introduce them to one another. It's not uncommon for you to think that a couple of people should be introduced, but you're not quite sure if one of them is ready for the introduction. Making the introductions really shows that trust between all of the parties. Contrast this with taking someone out to lunch. Let's say their lunch costs $10. 00. Making an introduction to somebody might be much more valuable than $10. 00. A proper introduction could be career changing. Also, this is something of value that you can do for many years to come. Can you imagine how valuable it would be if you had a mentoring relationship with someone for a year or two, and for the rest of your career they introduce you to great people? This is what I would consider a win-win-win. You win because you're strengthening the relationship that you have with the individuals that you've introduced, and each of the other parties win because they get their network expanded with relevant contacts.
Your Mentee Journal: Now What?

Let's revisit the journal that we talked about in the last module. The journal was a tool that you used during your mentoring sessions. You used it directly after your mentoring sessions to do debriefs and check your notes. This is something that you would do by yourself. You can also use your mentee journal between sessions to jot down ideas and inspiration that you got between your meetings. You should pull out your journal and review the notes in your journal regularly, not just of the last few sessions, but of the entire relationship. The mentoring relationship was a time where you were able to have a lot of introspection and write down things that you learned about yourself. All of those things should be valuable to you for the rest of your career. You could also go through and look for action items that you jotted down during your sessions that hadn't been checked off yet. It might not be appropriate at this point to even go do those action items, but some of them might be worth completing. As you go through this experience of revisiting your notes and your thoughts and the action items, you'll probably have ideas for new action items. Where do you put those? In your mentee journal. Keep it all in one place. Just as you've been doing for the last many months, use this journal as a place to continually debrief. You can follow-up with ideas in your journal for years to come, even after the formal mentoring relationship is done. Using the journal this way should give you a great tool to find more inspiration and even motivation as you move forward with your career goals. I would imagine by this time you have pages and pages and pages full of great inspiration and motivation.
What if You End on a Bad Note?

For most of this course, we've assumed that the relationship has gone pretty well. What if it hasn't gone well? What if you're ending the relationship under duress? Maybe you're even ending the relationship earlier than you thought you would. Here are some considerations. First, don't critique your mentor unless the mentor invites you to share what your thoughts are. Even if they invite you to share your thoughts, I would be very careful in what you share with them. I'm not saying that you have to be tight-lipped. Helping them understand what the problem was in the relationship could help them move forward in another mentoring relationship, but I suggest that you don't share any of this stuff unless they explicitly ask for the feedback. If you do share feedback, make sure that you do so tactfully. Remember when we talked about accepting feedback in the last module, we talked about focusing on behavior and not person or personality issues. It's the same thing here. You don't want to come across as attacking the other person, what you really want to do is identify opportunities where they can improve their actions or their behavior. This is only appropriate to do if they've invited you to have this conversation, and the best way to do it is diplomatically or with tact. Remember, at this point in the relationship, it's only natural to have hurt feelings, and maybe even embarrassment. Neither of you got involved in this relationship with the idea that it was going to end in a bad way. Be sensitive to those natural emotions, and realize that if the emotions are deep or heated, it might make any feedback that either of you give seem a lot harsher than it really is. I would also take an honest look at myself and think about what fault I brought to the table. Were there things that I could have done differently? I'm not saying that you need to look at this and say, okay, this is your fault, maybe if you did a bunch of things differently it wouldn't have ended so badly, but be honest with yourself and use this as a learning experience to think about how you could have acted differently in the relationship to have made it more successful. Even though things haven't gone the way that you've wanted them to go, I would try and focus on gratitude towards the time that they put into this, and any progress that you have made. What you don't want to do is burn bridges. If you focus on the gratitude and the progress, then you're salvaging the relationship enough so that maybe you could have a good peer-to-peer or colleague relationship down the road. Just because they weren't a good mentor or you weren't a good mentee in this relationship, doesn't mean that you have to scrap the entire relationship. Finally, let me suggest that you never talk bad about the mentor and what happened, to anyone else. We have a tendency where we want to share what happened with other people. Maybe we even want to justify our position or why we were not in the wrong, but talking bad about what happened, or specifically about the mentor, is never a good idea. It could certainly hurt them, but it also hurts you.
What Did I Miss?

As we come to the end of this module, and this entire course, let me invite you to share your thoughts on mentoring. What are things that you would suggest to other Pluralsight members to help them have richer mentoring relationships. Go to the Course page and find the Discussion link where you can leave your thoughts or your questions on how to be a better mentee.
Wrap-up

In this course, we talked about a number of things to help you move on from the formal mentoring relationship. We talked about what you might include in the last meeting, how to celebrate the end of the mentoring relationship, what you would include in the last email that you send as the mentee. We talked about how to focus now on the colleague or peer-to-peer relationship. We talked about the value that you could bring to them by making introductions. We also talked about the journal that you had, and still getting value out of the journal. Finally, we talked about some considerations if you happen to end on a bad note. Where do we go from here? First, it's time to put all of this stuff into practice. That means we need to get to work. In this course, we've talked about a lot of ideas. It might be overwhelming to think of all of the ideas that you could or should do, but let me suggest that even marginal improvement is great. Focus on a few tactics that you feel comfortable with, work on those, and then you can add other tactics from the course. For many, many years, and in many different scenarios and situations, mentoring has been an invaluable part of how we progress in our life and our careers. I hope that you can get more value out of your mentoring relationship as the mentee.
