(Shareware Version)

(c) KIDware (206) 721-2556



Course Description:

Learn Visual Basic 6 is a 10-week, self-paced overview of the Visual Basic programming language and environment.  Upon completion of the course, you will:

1. Understand the benefits of using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 as an application development tool. 
2. Understand the Visual Basic __event-driven programming__ concepts, __terminology__, and __available tools__.
3. Learn the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and distributing a wide variety of Visual Basic applications.

Learn Visual Basic 6 is presented using a combination of course notes (written in Microsoft Word format) and over 100 Visual Basic examples and applications.


__Course Prerequisites:__

To grasp the concepts presented in Learn Visual Basic 6, you should possess a working knowledge of Windows and have had some exposure to programming concepts.  If you have never programmed a computer before, you'll have to put in a little more effort - perhaps, find a book in your local library on programming using QBasic or some other dialect of the Basic computer language.

You will also need the ability to view and print documents saved in Microsoft Word format.  This can be accomplished in one of two ways.  The first, and easiest, is that you already have Microsoft Word on your computer.  The second way, and a bit more difficult, is that you can download the Microsoft Word Viewer.  This is a free Microsoft product that allows viewing Word documents - it is available for download at all the major shareware Internet sites (ZDNet, Download.Com, SoftSeek).

Finally, and most obvious, __you need to have Microsoft Visual Basic 6__, preferably the __Professional Edition__.  This is a separate product that __must be purchased__ - check out on-line software stores and auction sites.  Learn Visual Basic 6 does not cover the rudiments of navigating in Visual Basic 6.  You should be familiar with the simple tasks of using the menus, the toolbar, resizing windows, and moving windows around.  Visual Basic 6 provides an excellent tutorial with instruction on such tasks.

How To Take the Course:

Learn Visual Basic 6 is a self-paced course.  The suggested approach is to do one class a week for ten weeks.  Each week's class should require about 4 to 8 hours of your time to grasp the concepts completely.  Prior to doing a particular week's work, open the class notes file for that week and print it out.  Then, work through the notes at your own pace.  Try to do each example as they are encountered in the notes.  If you need any help, all solved examples are included in the VB Code folder.  After completing each week's notes, a homework exercise is given, covering many of the topics taught that week.  Like the examples, try to work through the homework exercise, or some variation thereof, on your own.  Refer to the completed exercise in the VB Code folder, if necessary.  Also included with each week's notes are Practice Problems - these are quick little examples to give you practice in writing Basic code.
